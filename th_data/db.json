community who has been with us for a long time and as you know we love you we appreciate you and we have a lot of fun for those who have not been on one of these town halls before i just want to share a little bit about how this works and then we'll jump into the questions so we do collect the questions beforehand and i think this time we had about 80 questions so we know that we won't get through all of them during this town hall but we try to get through as many as we can in addition things that can be found on the website or questions that we've answered in previous town halls those are ones that we'll probably skip today and we also don't engage in any price speculation or anything that could be um predictive we have you know lots of things going on lots of ideas lots of things that we um you know are love to share when those things happen but we um you know here we don't engage in um in any speculation we really just want to talk about hedera the network the technology the governing council how things work and a lot of the use cases that we're really seeing gain some traction today so um if you're if your question doesn't get answered please go ahead and submit for next month and you know we continue to do these we continue to see some great questions as the community evolves as the technology evolves and the use cases evolve so with that we will jump right in leemon

representative that comes to our council meetings and votes on behalf of them they also if they get involved in the committees decide which of their committee which of their members will come to the committees and when they sign transactions they decide on who's going to be doing the signing so we do not tell them what they have to do they decide how they want to employ their ability to govern

after they leave the organization they may not participate in that same way you know years from now they may continue to run notes just not as council members i mean that's quite possible as well they wouldn't participate formally in governance meaning that they wouldn't vote on certain issues that come before the council or votes but probably what's most important is are the relationships that they are building with each other while they're here on the council or part of the council those relationships of course would not end there'd be no reason for them to to uh in those relationships there are business relationships that are being created across council and that's part of the value proposition to the council members for joining the council in the first place they come in they

while virtually all of the initial projects uh you know did not gain mass adoption the financial infrastructure behind these tokens became a use case in and of itself and the value is somewhat circular and that it derives from being able to manipulate other tokens in a closed network but nevertheless there's network effect despite the composability of smart contracts ethereum has hit technical limitations of scalability can hedera use appnets to achieve this or is there an inherent loss of composability from off layer or layer 2 computation yeah so aptnets are a great way of doing this the consensus service hcs is a good way of doing some of these um defy and layer two kinds of things excuse me you can also use it as app nets as bridges and so you can have stuff from ethereum that is wrapped on hedera and stuff from hedera that is wrapped on ethereum and bridges between the different ledgers i think that where we are heading is that people want to be able to use multiple ledgers with bridges between them people are building bridges between us and other things which is good on hcs it's a really good use case for it and then people are also doing layer two stuff directly on us and then of course layer one stuff on us as well and i think what we're seeing is the world is going to this ecosystem where the network effects are spreading across ledgers where you can be on multiple ledgers and have them interoperate and we're starting to get more and more of that and so i'm very excited about using hcs and using the app nets in order to do layer two directly and even to be layer twos for other things you can use an hcs network as a plasma thing you could use um connections between the networks is is a fantastic thing and so more and more over time what

is your favorite use case that you have seen being built on hedera well you know so naming just one is sort of like picking your favorite child it's not really possible uh the interesting thing though is that we're seeing use cases sort of coalesce in a number of industries for example in healthcare and pharmaceuticals due to the pandemic we've seen an acceleration in the use cases that enable communication across multiple organizations and track global supply chains such as tracking also tracking the spread of the virus in addition to uh vaccines through the supply chain those types of things potentially a digital passport for organizations like airlines and and concerts that would help us sort of return to normal in some ways so you know these perhaps wouldn't have otherwise developed outside of the context of the pandemic but they're interesting to have have seen you know emerge as a result of the pandemic we're also seeing use cases around supply chains of all kinds and

provide tools that make it easier to meet those requirements so for example if you're issuing a token there is uh there there is a check box there for koic controls to be used in in the token issuance um our file system our distributed file system it's possible to have what we call controlled mutability if you need to delete something from the file system you can get a proof from us from the

build a public network on top of hashgraph so we we hired our initial team and we wrote a white paper in 2018 we introduced the dare to the world 2018 was about uh making that introduction raising a lot of money which we did and launching the network in a private context the network actually went live in september of 2018. we also started council recruitment right it's a big part of what hedera is 2019 was all about operationalizing the council finishing the initial set of services that were going to be launched are opened to the public we uh had our initial council announced their first five members in february of 19 we launched or opened the network what we call open access we opened the network in september of 19 and then we started getting market feedback we started seeing how the market was using those services in ways that were a little bit unexpected and in 2020 we were reacting to market demand and market research to try and get a good product market fit that resulted in the hedera consensus service it also resulted in the hedera tokenization service which was just launched a couple months ago if that but it was all about understanding market demand for our peculiar specific features and and what they offer and getting product market fit i think that we are near product market fit there's still work to be done to to optimize and tweak but it's pretty good and it's being used by a lot of people today and so then the question is if you once you get product market fit it's all about sort of scaling as fast as you can and removing getting to that point means you're removing the friction points to scale removing the friction or those obstacles that prevent adoption in a very meaningful and scalable way we're we're just at the edge of that i mean there there are a lot of projects that are using this today we continue to learn uh but this year is about finalizing that having product market fit and then and then adoption and you know there are a whole set of activities that are associated with adoption that we could go into as well maybe that's what you're asking about but that's what i'm talking about and it's all about having all of that work behind us and focusing on scale as an organization as a community uh and and that's that's the context and that's what i meant all right thanks mance um leemon another clarifying question", "title":

treasury and if they did that would you wouldn't be a fan of that but don't the council members decide how the treasury coins are staked to their nodes or is there another governing authority that decides this if it is indeed the council isn't that the same thing as the council owning coins oh no this is what's cool yes it is the council that makes all these decisions so the council stakes the coins to the council members when we have community nodes they may stake some of the coins to community nodes but the council as a whole makes that decision so the whole council has to vote and have a majority voting to make a decision like that once 139th of the nodes is given to one of the 39 council members you know that's how it will end up before we have community members then that council member gets the benefit from it but they can't unilaterally by themselves take their share of the coins and sell them and go off and have a vacation in the bahamas they can't do that they don't have control of it by themselves they just are one vote on the whole council while the whole council is deciding what to do with all of the coins so it's uh it's it's like congress voting on what to do with money no single congress person can go take their share of of all the money in the world and go off and do something with it they just have their piece of the vote and then it's the vote as a whole that decides what happens with the money same thing with the council so councilman a single council member does not get control of a single share of those coins but the council as a whole controls all the coins so that's very important for governance for good governance and for preventing uh one rogue actor from doing something bad which is what we're always and that's what ledgers are

answers questions to the world is run by anybody and so that's step one we have that right now and we even talked about that the one click deployment in google cloud for a mirror node if you wanted to do that or you just download the software and run it yourself anybody can run the mirror nodes right now the council is running the main net nodes the next step step two is when there will be community members running mainnet nodes in addition to those mirror nodes and they will be community members that are known and trusted then step three is anonymous community members and so anonymous people can run a node where no one knows who they are all we know is the ip address and um so that would be the third step so those are the three steps for the main net nodes and in step one of the

none of us could have predicted uh on along those lines what would happen to the network in the event that a cme which means coronal mass ejection wiped out the entire globe's power supply is there a copy of the ledger stored in a secure incorruptable location yeah a um a severe cme would uh kind of ruin your day in a lot of ways so seeing this happen all the time but what we're talking about is one of these things that happens every couple hundred years or every few hundred years uh could be really bad the last time it happened we were in the world of telegraphs and even telegraph wires were picking up energy and and they were able to send telegraph messages without even using their batteries that was funny and it was interesting today would be an unmitigated disaster to the world and it will probably happen eventually so what will happen is that a lot of things get fried it depends on exactly how bad things are as to whether every car in the world has its electrical system fried and every computer in the world has its electrical system fried um if that happens you know civilization has some real problems as for our ledger we do have backups uh and some of it is cold storage i think cold storage ends up being hard drives and then it becomes tape tape should do fine so cme is not really a magnetic event mainly what it is it's a magnetic field that's changing but what it does is it induces currents and probably magnetic tape would be okay uh hard drives it's very possible that the platters would be fine but the electronics would be fried and if that happened then the only way to recover it is you have to take it into a clean room and and carefully open it up and move the platter from one hard drive to another although maybe the electronics would be okay it depends we don't really know the metal enclosures would probably protect it itself from induced currents but then the problem is that it's plugged into your power supply and your your into the mains and the power grid would have these enormous surges but then there's ways of stopping that and big data centers have ways of stopping the surges so the answer is yeah giant cme would be bad and it's not entirely sure how bad it would be um my biggest concerns would be food and water which could be really big concerns but i do think that um we would have backups that would be able to recover from once

and these bridges are going to have to be trusted and the way you do that is you have something like a state proof where you have digital signatures from one ledger absolutely positively guaranteeing that something happened so you have to have finality and then you need to have some way of proving that the final thing at finality was the thing you're claiming that it is and we need that for the communication between the shards and between ledgers so we're going to need thousands per second within a shard we're going to need multiple shards multiple ledgers and we're going to need state

you um are you still working on other math unsolved problems and if so which ones oh of course yeah so um this is fun this is just what i do in my free time and i've got some problems i've been working on for years i've got problems in graphics i've got problems in sailor automata these little fake universes like conway's game of life i've got problems in unkey jam resistance how can radios talk without having keys there's some fun math problems in that both in the previous kind bbc that i had a phd student a long time ago do and he got his phd and then currently i have another phd student right now working on on a different kind of problem uh with unkey jam resistance i've got robotics problems there's interesting combinatorial problems just in the design of the body of a robot fun stuff i even work on the collats problem which every mathematician says you should never work on because it will take up all your time and you'll never get anywhere but i had this really cool idea recently it's one more way of trying to attack collapse um will i ever achieve anything on that probably not um but it doesn't matter it's just fun these problems come back and you know gnaw at me and of the stuff that i just mentioned of several of those i've actually solved recently so i do sometimes solve these problems collats i wouldn't put money on it but it's fun but i thought that you know each of these problems is actually simple enough i could actually explain it and you would understand the problem these are the problems that i like are the problems that are really easy to state and so i thought maybe it'd be fun to show you one would you like to see one i can show you one of the problems so well since i didn't hear any answers i'll take that as a yes oh yeah somebody texted yes so here's a tree you know that gray circle has two circles below it that each have two circles below it's a complete tree it's a binary tree because they always have two children and it goes down five layers uh imagine that it goes down a thousand layers but this example he goes down five layers and i give you a box of crayons so i give you a bunch of colors here i'm giving you six colors maybe um you'll have thousands of colors but the tree's a thousand layers deep you have a bunch of colors and your job is to color the tree the the goal is to find a coloring and this is all we want we just want to have an assignment of a color to each circle in the tree this is a coloring of the tree and you notice there's two blues right next to each other that's okay we're not going to worry about that what i want is for the colors to be spread out a lot not bunched up in the following way and i don't know how to do it this is a problem that's kind of fun i don't know how to color a tree so the colors are spread out in this way so here's what we want we want to make sure that all the little trees also have lots of colors so here's what i'm saying we want every single big sub tree to be colorful to have lots of colors in it so here's a subtree a subtree is when you start at the top you go down each of the pads just part of the way so i'm not including every single circle on the screen i'm only including seven of the circles seven vertices from this tree that is a sub tree if you look at this gray subtree it's got six different colors in it that's lots of colors that that's all the colors wow that one's really colorful uh if you look at a different subtree here's a different subtree i like the shape of that one h bar this sub tree has five colors in it that's still a lot of colors great maybe this thing is colorful maybe this graph actually has been colored this tree has been colored where all the sub trees have lots of colors no it's bad look at that one that has seven vertices but it only has two colors okay so we failed this coloring of the big tree is wrong because there's at least one little tree that is not having lots of colors so the question is can you think of a way to color a big tree say a thousand layers deep within colors so every time you take a sub tree of more than seven in you're going to have lots of colors more than n over three colors so the tree depth is a thousand n is a million and i've made some progress like i proved a theorem that says just roll dice and color every circle randomly and you'll almost certainly get the right answer it'll actually work you there's a 99.99999 percent chance that you will actually get the right answer just by coloring the tree totally randomly so it's kind of hard to know that you have the right answer though because there's a whole lot of little sub trees to look at and so i don't yet know a single answer to this problem even though every random answer almost every random answer is correct it's like looking for hay in a haystack you can go grab something but there's always that little tiny chance it's a needle so i'm not looking for a needle in a haystack i'm looking for hay in a haystack but i haven't sold it yet kind of fun you know anything about expander graphs from the early days of graph theory that was the same way they knew that almost every random graph is an expander graph and they didn't know of a single example same thing here okay so that's just the example um i i don't know if you find this fun but i think puzzles are fun and that math problem is a fun math problem and hey if you ever solve it let me know i'd love to see the solution and we will publicize you you'd be great so that's my hobby thank you leemon love it um we are running way short

donating them i have donated them to hedera i am also going to write up a piece of paper that i signed that says these are the original coins from 2018 you know certificate of genuineness that will be donated to hedera hedera is going to have an auction hedera is writing the software right now to do the auction or at least that is open source community members will be able to run nodes as part of

the ethereum network especially once the hedera network is deployed and tuned to full scale sure so we have smart contracts and smart contracts can do anything they're turing complete but they have limitations in speed and other things and so what you want to do is find ways of doing your business logic in a way that is fast compared to a smart contract so we have hcs and hts so if you recall hcs is our consensus service it allows you to build an app.net and you can run you can write your program in any language you want and it runs at native speed which is you know as fast as you could possibly get furthermore since it's running on one app net of many it has that whole app net to itself and maybe doesn't have a whole lot of other traffic and so it has the whole computer to itself and can run much faster so if you really want speed you want to be able to run in any language have it compiled run on its own little network and and then divide up the the work between different little networks that's what the consensus service is for and then sometimes you want even lower latency than that and you want it even more convenience than that and so then what you do is you take specific items and instead of having them as smart contracts you build it into the bottom layer itself you make them native to the ledger and that's the name the hedera token service is making tokens native to the ledger itself and so you can do many thousands of token transfers per second and uh and you have all the security of hedera you don't have to look at a smart contract and wonder if there's any bugs in it it's just hedera itself is doing the token so lots of nice advantages to having tokens on hedera itself oh plus you have this great interoperability is that you can transfer tokens from one person to another even if they're different types of tokens and you can do it atomically and do it multi-way so i give alice a token she gives bob a token bob gives me a token and there are three different kinds of tokens created by different people but we have a single transaction that does it all maybe it moves some h bars too maybe um i'm giving alice several different kinds of tokens at the same time all of that uh and then it's just it's atomic either the whole transaction happens or none of it happens so lots of nice advantages to that so the answer is yeah you can always do smart contracts but if you want real speed you want to use any language you want and you even want to have parallelization then you can use the cert consensus service and if it's tokens you can use the token service for extra speed all right thanks leemon mance this next one is for you", "title": "What is the expected worldwide performance of smart contracts on Hedera Hashgraph?"},

you share your feedback and insights on how the price of hbar as it rises will impact transaction fees and the cost of using the network or platform yeah well so let me just start by saying that in the past what is this this is the end of february so in the past six weeks the price of the token has gone from approximately 3 cents to i don't know 12 to 15 cents the price per transaction hasn't budged it's been fixed and that's by design the costs of transactions are denominated in dollars and it doesn't matter what the price of the token is it's you know it's going to fluctuate it's going to go up and down but anybody building on the platform that needs to plan for the future what they're you know understand what their future costs are going to be when they make api calls they don't have to worry about that and what actually happens behind the scenes is that there is an sdk that developers can use as part of building their applications and when they want to make api calls it will tell them how many hbar is required for a given api call and i think it's about an once every hour leemon you can correct me but i think it's about once every hour the number of hbars required for a given api call is adjusted based on the the current average price of h bars in the market so uh you know we we understood from the very beginning that that was a problem that had to be resolved and so it was built in you know the solution i described as built in from day one all right thanks mance um leemonn uh can hedera be", "title": "Feedback and insights on how the price of HBAR will impact

ethereum there's lots of l2 solutions that are cool in some cases they're making up because the underlying ledger is pretty slow but you know ultimately everyone does l2s for various things and an l2 is a computer or a set of computers that have to be doing some things there's some communication involved there may be some agreement involved you could even imagine l2 systems that involve multi-signatures going on there's all sorts of interesting things you can do in an l2 kind of network and how can you set up a little network of computers that all work together well you can you can do this with uh corda and and hyper ledger and other ways of kind of setting up a little network you can write your own code from scratch but how do you make them all be communicating with each other and coming to an agreement if they need to be doing that if they need to jointly sign a transaction how do you do that how can you do things with oracle's where you need to have a bunch of computers watching something and then signing that something actually happened in all of those cases hcs may be the ideal thing to do so you build your hyperledger recorded thing that you plug in hcs or you just build your thing from scratch but you use it on top of hcs a consensus service and that allows you to have very rapid communication with all the nodes in the in your l2 system whatever it's doing and you get this record of everything they've ever done because it's going through hcs you have this immutable permanent record of everything they've done and if they need to come to agreements on things there's a very easy way to do it if they want to say well we will accept gossiped ideas from other people until a certain point in time well guess what everything flowing through hcs gets a time stamp on it and so we'll all agree on which messages came before that time and which ones didn't if you need to do joint signatures on something you can use hcs to to communicate between yourselves um there's just a lot of nice things of having a reliable atomic broadcast with consensus timestamps attached to it and a consensus ordering attached to it and that's what acs gives you so i love the idea of building l2 solutions for every ledger in the world and then i love the idea of doing that on hcs it's a really good match because you have high throughput and you have this

anything it doesn't like hurt liquidity of the market um if you burned half the us dollars in the world you have some problems because you can't get smaller than a cent but when you can divide into 100 million pieces it's not a big deal so every ledger has this issue where people lose their coins this way some ledgers actually allow you to burn but you get the same effect if you just lock it up

cryptocurrency um a couple years after that do you still feel the same and uh do you think quantum computing could benefit or enhance hedera oh yeah so sure i still feel the same and so do you know the world's cryptographers and the world's quantum physicists so i think quantum computing is really cool and it continues to make progress just today actually i was reading an article where about um passive quantum error correction uh someone had another yet another scheme for doing passive quantum error correction which is cool because it's usually the active kind that you hear about um cool cool stuff it is possible that we'll have quantum computers that can break crypto in the next 10 years that's conceivable now it may not it may not happen it may be a lot more than 10 years but we could imagine that it might happen in the next 10 years we'll have computers that can can break um quantum um the kinds of crypto that we currently do you could do that with quantum computers so that would be extremely exciting and when we do that then of course all the ledgers in the world will keep the same hashes they have now except they'll have to make the the number of bits slightly bigger we're already bigger we're at 384. um it's recommended to go from 256 to 384 so we're already post quantum in our hashes you'll have to use good encryption but everybody uses aes 256 and that's post quantum everyone thinks that's secure and so you know we'll continue you know using that in our tls connections and then the other two things that people care about is uh public key encryption which um we're not doing and publix key signatures and so for most ledgers that's the part that has to be updated for quantum and there are a bunch of algorithms that we think are secure against quantum computers and so we'll just switch to those and um and i imagine that all the ledgers in the world will switch to those if it looks like we're within five years of having such a computer we'll do so it doesn't look at all like that right now um you can even look at people like the us government when they protect their own secrets they use stuff that can be broken by a quantum computer the the standards for for top secret the cnsa standard says hey yeah you can use this stuff that could easily be broken by a giant quantum computer and what they have said is that they believe and you know they're protecting information supposed to say secure for 30 years they've said you know we think quantum computers may actually come along at some point so we do want to switch to algorithms that are secure post quantum algorithms and so they told this to go have a have a go ahead and have a contest but they didn't say there was a rush they don't even think that their 30-year information their information has to be stored for 30 years and kept secret is being threatened by quantum computers right now but nist is doing this contest and it's very possible um it's been fun to watch the contest it's very possible that next year it'll end and we'll have a list of what the world's top cryptographers all agree are secure algorithms secure meaning well we don't think a quantum computer can break it um and we've tried really hard we haven't thought of a way yet which is the best you could do in crypto most crypto is like that so you know then all the ledgers in the world can talk about switching to it the problem is that it's inconvenient a signature may be kilobytes in size whereas right now it's just a few bytes like 32 bytes but you know it'll be kilobytes in size for a signature that's inconvenient and it's more expensive it uses more bandwidth and so you know no one's in a rush to do that and especially right now we don't even know if the algorithms are secure it's worth waiting at least another year until this gets done or two years however long it takes them and then we can be sure that we have a secure algorithm and then i imagine ledgers will offer it as an option but very few people will want to pay for that because there's no urgency there are enough people working on quantum computers in public that when we get within five years of that goal we'll know it we're not it's not going to happen overnight we're not going to wake up one morning and say there's a quantum computer that can break all the world's crypto so we're going to have years in advance of warning that's at least that's what all of the current what the vast majority of cryptographers in the world would say what the vast majority of quantum physicists would say um all of that the good news is that there will be uses for quantum computers before they're big enough to do that especially in simulations of quantum systems and that's an extremely exciting use case for them and so we'll see maybe we'll get that maybe grover's algorithm be useful too you can make anything faster by a square root but i'm not holding my breath on that i think it's going to take a while till we get to that point but we'll get there eventually maybe and i i really hope we do um we shall see uh so no worries oh and you asked if it could help us um it's not obvious right now that can help us either a quantum computer can't do everything it can only do very narrow things and at the moment it's not obvious that any of those very narrow things would actually be helpful for a computer but if somebody someone discovered something weird like you could do fully homomorphic encryption efficiently on a quantum computer then yeah ledgers might start using quantum computers but at the moment no one's no one has any idea that even if we had giant quantum computers how it could help ledgers just how it could hurt us and so you know we'll switch our signature schemes when when the time comes i hope that makes sense i think quantum computing is really fun i've taught courses on it and it's just a really fun subject but um we'll see it's fun to watch watch the progress very cool thanks leemon all right

just facebook but twitter and email and all kinds of social media i think that the consensus service is a great way to build it and i think it's interesting we're seeing a lot of different social media today taking some heat for various things and people are saying we really need to make alternatives and hedera will not be a social service with all of the censorship that implies and perhaps the advertising that implies hedera is providing a consensus service and you can create companies on top of us or open source software on top of us or you know just give it away or sell it or however you want to set up your system that uses the consensus service to provide a social network and the mirror nodes remember what's been pushed through it it can be used for real-time messaging just by itself and if you use the mirror nodes you can also have the history of the things you might integrate a file service even the hedera file service for part of it and i think it'd be great for people to build social media on top of the consensus service on top of hedera i personally would like to have um have different choices of social services or not social services um social media uh and i would love to see some people building some of those and uh yeah go for it i think it's a good thing all right um related to that man what else", "title": "Will Hedera Hashgraph provide an alternative

protocols like it absolutely i you know there's no question only even in the past few years we've really began to understand the full breadth of how this new technology distributed consensus as we understand it today is going to be used and i talked about this last time and we've made a big deal about hts and the tokenization service in fact i wrote an article for i think was published in coindesk in december talking about the convergence of three industry trends the move of business logic player two the use of tokens in ways that previously were um you know not anticipated tokenization the the rise of tokenization and define decentralized finance componentized finance what's interesting and noteworthy as it relates to this question is that if you took any one of those out of the picture then the solutions that can be built using the combination of them some of them would just not be possible and what what we'll see and continue to see is that different categories of infrastructure get defined and built out and when that happens it enables new classes of use cases it's because we're so early in this there's just no way that people have figured out um you know what the full range of of applications there are there are a lot more today that can be built and add real fundamental value than what there were before part of that is just the performance of the platform i mean we've what we have in adera is the ability to have 10 000 tps today throttled with seconds of latency and really low cost that by itself just just the fact that we now have consensus with those properties enabled new categories of use cases combining that with other categories of infrastructure that are complementary just um accelerates that so there's just it's impossible to really predict but what we do know is that there are probably two decades of growth here in understanding and um and realization of the full potential of the new category of technology thanks mance

use it to do bad things with it and be careful that you're not wasting your money on something that is a scam so the only alternative to asking you to be careful is for big brother to come in and stamp out all the scams on our on our network well we can't do that we can't censor it we can't we we don't even have the ability in the code to delete smart contracts uh or tokens so you need to do your own research to make sure you're not getting suckered into something it was like whoever invented email could have designed it so that all emails go through him and he can censor them another alternative is that you just need to be smart when you get that email from that dictator that would like to give you millions of dollars if you'll just pay a small fee maybe you don't respond to it um you know it's just we have to it i hate the fact that this is a world where there's scammers out there and the world is full of scammers you just need to protect yourself and and don't don't send your money anywhere unless you're sure about what you're doing we are more like the internet that carries all those emails we don't know what the emails say and we don't censor the emails and we don't delete the emails we're just the wire that's carrying the emails that's our goal so uh yes please be careful there is a lot of bad stuff going on out there as for what do we call our erc20 well i'll tell you what we call our erc20 ooh it's hard to do that this the hook and the hedera token service we have we have tokens at the native player so it's like the rc20 at the native layer and and if you use the hts then you get the native layer speeds you get the negative native layer of prices you get the native layer trust which actually is better than erc20 in one sense if some person claims to have a smart contract that's an erc20 you need to go check well are there any bugs in the smart contract or did they use exactly the code that somebody else used that someone else has already checked but if we tell you that it's just the native hts service then you know the properties of it and so you don't have to go research each individual token you just know the tokens in general so there's security and cost and speed reasons to use hts uh although i will point out we do have smart contracts they do run solidity you can put erc20 contracts on them and so then in that case the erc20s are called erc20 but there's a lot of advantages of using this thing instead of erc20s but you have that choice all right thanks leemon and we appreciate the the ymca version there as well did you notice

the sdk rotates sending transactions through the nodes how is dropping every 15th transaction prevented when the transaction is sent to a down node oh yeah no transactions are dropped so that doesn't happen so the way it works is that like what the sdk does is it'll pick a node at random and if that node you can't connect to it it just goes to a different node it doesn't drop the transaction you don't lose a transaction at worst you would lose the one or two seconds or whatever it takes you to realize that that node is not responding you could even make that shorter if you wanted to so so nothing is lost furthermore if you wanted to be smart what you could do is program it to say um don't even just choose them at random choose at random those that i have not had any problems with recently and then you even saved the second or two of time that it would have taken you to wait to know that it's not good so if a node's not good you talk to it less often so we absolutely recommend that you pick nodes at random maybe even pick at random where your distribution is you don't pick it so often if it has been down recently but we definitely do not lose any transactions that way the only way you could lose a transaction is if you handed the transaction to the node and then the node crashed which is you know extremely low probability if that happened yeah then you lose your transaction you have to try again you just try again so you know you wait it waited three or four seconds you say oh it never reached consensus and then you try again so or wait two minutes and you know it's out actually has become stale and can't run because usually the um the transaction itself has a time limit so you wait till that's done and do it but uh but generally you're not going to have any problems just run the code of the sdk you should be fine and if you want to be clever you could say don't go to certain nodes that i haven't had good luck with recently that would be a little bit more clever if you were really into speed you could submit your transaction to several different nodes at once you pay a little bit more but then you have if even one of those nodes is fast you get the fastest of those nodes and that's another way of dealing with it lots of ways to deal with it depending on what you're what your situation is but you don't lose transactions they are not

for probably hcs is how you would do it for a stock market within milliseconds of submitting your transaction it becomes irrevocable you can't do anything to get it back because it has started gossiping and in a fraction of a second it's gossip to all the nodes and so at that point not only can you not undo your transaction but it's you have now received credit for having submitted it and whoever submitted first will win so the contest to be the first one to get it in is going to be a fraction of a second now it's going to be a larger fraction of a second when we're talking about multiple computers than if we're talking about a single computer so that fraction of a second is going to be bigger for a network than it is for a single computer the new york stock exchange but your bid becomes irrevocable you can't undo it within a small number of milliseconds and um and reach has reached all the nodes and has its point in history essentially set within a fraction of a second and then within a few seconds you get consensus and you could say oh that's terrible a few seconds to get consensus well sure but the consensus is just putting the stamp of approval on something that happened during that first fraction of a second and furthermore because it's a ledger you can talk about well it's the bid and the ask being matched i mean we know who's gonna who's going to have it be sold to them but we can also do clearing and settling all at once you give me the stock and i give you the money at the same time and all that could happen within three seconds so this is the nice thing is that with ledgers it doesn't take days to to do clearing and settling and you know if you send someone a wire it can take days everything can happen within those three seconds and so you've locked yourself in in a matter of milliseconds and then you find out the result of everything including clear and settling and all the other stuff within a few seconds so ledgers can be very good for markets i think and if you want to stop front running already being fast makes it harder but there's ways of you commit to a hash and you open the hash and you have punishment if you don't open the hash there's various ways you can do that even if you want to but i do think that ledger is actually a really good thing for markets especially because you can do all the clearing and settling and everything else along with your matching all at once and you get paid instantly and everything can happen instantly and you can have more privacy if you wanted to as well or maybe you don't want more

printed it on my 3d printer in plastic but then i went to shapeways and got it metal and so i actually have two of them this one is polished steel nickel and this one is polished steel gold which means steel with i think some copper mixed in maybe maybe it's maybe it's gold-plated i don't know it's not real gold shapeless will do that by the way you can buy a 3 000 gold coin or a 7 000

can see through the coin oh there we go oh look at that you can see the serial number so well you can't read it it says 001 so i even stamped a serial number on this and i think what we're going to do is we'll um we'll release this where if you want to buy a coin through shapeways you can you know get your own metal coin maybe we'll release the stl files you could print it yourself i don't know but for this particular coin the one that i printed that uh i had created in 2018 as i have had since then i'm going to give this one away so i think what we're going to do is we're going to make a certificate of authenticity it is serial numbered i stamped a serial number on it today with a hammer and a stamp set and we're going to tokenize it so there will be a token in our hts system for this coin and we will auction it off and give the money to charity and we have a charity in dallas that helps single mothers that are homeless and so homelessness is a huge problem i have fear it may grow and in the recent cold it's an even really worst problem uh you know guys on eight degrees here which to people in dallas is really really cold and if you're homeless that is cold anywhere um minus 20

december and we learned our lesson that we probably shouldn't take a break because we had so many questions come in in january so we will definitely not be able to get to all of them today we will try to get to as many as we possibly can but rest assured that we have um you know we know they are in there they are in the queue and we will try to make sure that we answer them um either in you know in faqs or somewhere else or next month if we run out of time we try to focus on content that is new and educational for the community so anything that is in an faq somewhere else or is already on our blog or our website we will you know we will try to avoid those because we want to spare people who have heard that probably more times than they can imagine and then the other thing that we do not do here is uh you know is to speculate on hbar we will let you guys have fun doing that and but to start off with i did want to have leemon just address you know", "title": "Intro"}, {"end_time": 195.0,

on the network yeah this is great so we we have always said that there's volatility in the crypto market and certainly we're seeing a lot of volatility recently which is why we set the prices for the transactions in dollars and convert that to h bars and the conversion ratio automatically updates itself as the market fluctuates and so what it means is that if it goes up a million fold or goes down a millionth it doesn't matter the dollar price of the transaction stays the same and we smooth out the market a little bit so the market might get a little bit ahead of us or a little bit behind us but are a little bit ahead of us i guess either way uh but uh but that's what we do and so our prices are the same and so if the coin price triples the price of a transaction is still the same in fiat it's just um one-third in h bars but we we smooth out the volatility and so that was something we planned from the very beginning and i think that recent events are showing that hey that's a pretty good idea so that's what we have all right thank you leemon so we've got a lot to tackle today mance i'm going to jump right in the first question is for you is hedera a good fit for cbdc", "title":

hedera consensus service in that architecture but as novia said we have a bunch of new people joining the community so i'm going to take just a moment to describe that with normal layer one networks they perform two functions transactions flow into the network and they get put into a consensus order a stream of order transactions is created and then those transactions flow into sort of the business logic layer which is normally referred to as smart contract layer and they get operated on in those smart contracts the the smart contracts operate on the transactions that have been ordered that has problems in that it can be slow you have all the smart contracts in the world created by all the developers using that platform competing for the same cpu cycles on that platform those the information flowing through the smart contracts has to be decrypted it can't be encrypted uh that's a big problem the industry is trying to resolve so it's you've got privacy or security uh pii concerns or you know just information generally you may not want to be public it's gonna be public if it's being operated on those smart contracts and and because of the the the congestion of the networks the cost to operate these smart contracts is really high what we did was we split the smart contracts layer off you can think of it conceptually like exposing just the consensus layer and moving the business logic into another network it could be a private network it could be a public network it's just not running on our main net nodes this architecture makes it possible to create a ledger for cbdc uh in it with the degree of flexibility and security and privacy and cost structure that you simply can't do on a public ledger using smart contracts for cbdc so the the simple answer to the question is yes the way in which it would be done presumably is that any government that wanted to create a cbdc would create a separate network that manages the ledger for their cbdc the hedera consensus service could play a role in putting transactions in order and the you know taking advantage of that public ledger trust model but the scalability the security the flexibility in being able to do anything you can imagine in a network for the management of this of this currency including kyc aml controls you can layer identity on top of it all of that could be done in the private network then of course markets that use the token the the coin could run directly on top of hedera you know there there are a lot of sort of secondary or tertiary uh uses of of the coin that could run on top of adera directly but the the actual ledger for the coin and the management of that would not be done directly on hedera so that's a little bit long-winded but um but hopefully that

CBDC creation?"}, {"end_time": 608.0, "start_time": 435.0, "text": "the consensus layer eventually become autonomous like bitcoin okay so amir knows don't need constant human intervention all the mirror node is is a computer that is automatically downloading files continuously it checks the signatures on those files to make sure they really do represent what the by what the network as a whole has had as its consensus and then they parse it out and put it in a database and answer queries from users so that's what a mirror node is doing and we've written mirror node software and some people are running our software and then some people just written their own from scratch to read those files and download them and check their signatures and answer questions from them so that just happens autonomously if your computer goes offline for a while when it comes back online it should just be able to download you know keep downloading files and download the ones that it missed and and catch up shouldn't be a problem if if we change the format of the files themselves that of course if something happens very rarely but if we do that then if you've written your own software to parse those files you need to update your software i mean so i guess that's manual but if you're using our software you don't have to do that you just download our new software so it's pretty straightforward now that's for our current mirror nodes we do have um a different kind of mirror node that we may have in the future where your mirror node is just like a node on the network and in that case it's um i won't go into all the details but it should be able to do the things that the network does where it could automatically reconnect when it drops off and it'll be more interesting um just gives you lower um lower latency and gives you state proofs and things but we don't have state proofs yet but when we have state proofs we'll be improving the mirror nodes to allow you to have state proofs from the mirror node itself but right now what you can have is sort of like a state proof you can get from the mirror node the signatures on one of these files and then you can look in the file to see the information you're interested in so what we'll be changing the future is a more fine-grained one but but that will also be pretty autonomous and then even the software updates will be autonomous as for the main nets themselves the nodes are autonomous to upgrade the software right now what we do is have a human load the new software in and so um you know a lot of ledgers work that way if you want if there's going to be a new software version you have to download and decide whether to load it or not you do that manually we are actually we have code on the network that we haven't used yet but we're debugging and working with it that'll let even that happen automatically and so even the software upgrades will happen with no human involved at the at the node it'll just happen automatically if the if it is triggered by a transaction that was signed by more than two-thirds of the nodes so the consensus will do it and so that'll be coming um but right now the way it works is that a human updates the software but in the future even that will be automated so that's where we're headed thanks leemon that's helpful mance our next question", "title": "Do mirror nodes need

goods manufacturers in north america to update the way coupons are are managed and they're using hedera to provide that layer of trust so that all of the different participants in sort of the supply

weeks and months and we um you know i i believe they expect to be on boarding some pretty large tier ones as well during that time so uh i don't know exactly what those transaction rates are going to look like in terms of tps but we should start seeing some numbers soon and i think that there have out again there have already been some number of transactions on the network as they set up the

about this um this is really interesting so imagine first of all in the consensus we use time stamps right you take the median time stamp on an event and that's what we use to put them in order within a round and then that gives you your time stamp and it's a fair time stamp and it's really cool for fairness you need most of the computers having sort of accurate times roughly but what would happen if an attacker could completely control the clock on every computer in the network so every time the computer asked its clock what time is it the attacker could make it always say zero it's always time zero for everybody or he could make it be random and say well first i say it's time zero then i say it's a million years from now then i say it's a million years ago and it's random every time i ask it is it even an order if i ask at the time several times in a row it doesn't even give me answers in order or maybe the attacker makes every computer in the in the entire network always agree that we're in the middle of the middle ages and it's you know a long time ago or we're a million years in the future um not sure we have enough bits actually for that but you know convinces everybody that's 1970 right now would that hurt us in any way it would have zero effect on the speed at which we get consensus and the uh consensus of our consensus you know we're all going to get the same answer so what will happen in any of those attack scenarios is that when you submit a transaction it will still reach consensus just as fast as it always has we will still put them into consensus order the consensus order will still be um uniform across all of us we all agree all the nodes agree you can still trust it the network will be just blazing ahead just the way it always has there are no problems at all you will of course i would assume start getting some nonsense times you know you'll start seeing like my transaction happen in the year one million or whatever uh because of course if all the clocks are wrong how would it know what the time is but you'll still have a guarantee that all the nodes agree on the time of each transaction and that every transaction has an official consensus timestamp that is later than the one before it they will always be in order even if the clocks give you numbers out of order on every single computer the transactions themselves will have times in order and so we have very strong guarantees about that we even have a low resolution fairness if you submit your transaction and then three seconds later it has consensus and then i submit my transaction mine will definitely come later than yours in the consensus order so you know with a three three second uh resolution we even have sort of like fairness what you lose is the fine grain fairness the fine brain fairness says if my transaction reaches all the nodes in the network or most of the nodes in the network a little bit later than yours even a tiny bit later yours should count as coming first and that fine-grained transaction fairness is what you would lose if we didn't have clocks and that's why we used clocks in the protocol but the protocol itself the hashgraph algorithm would work absolutely fine if you got rid of clocks in every entirely and just set the clock on every computer to always be zero and just ignore the clocks so i'm not worried about attacks now the other good news is that if most of the nodes more than two-thirds of the nodes are honest and they're doing their best to get the right time but you know some clocks are a little bit fast and some are a little bit slow and some are a little bit off what kind of a time do we get because we're taking the median it kind of averages out all the errors and so you'll actually find in that scenario that the consensus time stamp is more accurate than any single computer's clock that would be what you would expect and so on average if you were to ask one computer when did this no this message reach most of the nodes if it could actually spy on all the nodes it would even be less accurate than what we get from hedera because hedera has used the meaning of all those clocks so this is this is great we don't need the time protocol consensus works fine without it but if you care about the time stamps like you have a legal contract that says it has to be done by noon on tuesday then our timestamps are very reliable and they give you low resolution fairness automatically but if you have even roughly good clocks they give you high resolution fairness so that's what we've had with the time stems

maybe maybe it's that long and there's a range of participants across the special interest groups and they are learning from each other about their product offerings about how they're using the network um there are synergies that sort of develop and hopefully emerge through the six uh one of those for example well so the first three that we focused on was identity uh data integrity and

develop between themselves?"}, {"end_time": 1360.0, "start_time": 1129.0, "text": "smart contract execution um aren't on chain smart contracts a critical part of d5 and gaming and other applications ah great question because um logic is a great part of those but there's multiple ways to do logic so we do smart contracts but we have other ways too so smart contracts have been there from the beginning they're still here they still do exactly what they did on day one there's nothing wrong with them they haven't broken and you can still use them just like you could in the beginning and lots of ledgers have smart contracts and you can use them for lots of purposes and so maybe there are use cases where you would want to use our smart contracts and you can do it but it is inherently the case that smart contracts end up having to run serially they end up having to run on every node in the network and there is a limit to how fast you can do that when every node is doing the computation and it is being done serially there are also limitations on how much privacy you can have with a smart contract there are some things you could talk start talking about doing with encryption and even homomorphic encryption but that's going to be incredibly slow so so smart contracts are a great tool but they don't do everything and what you really want is a way of doing this logic much much faster than just a vanilla smart contract running on a main net and so what everybody has been doing around the world is finding various ways that you can offload it in a way that still has the trust of the main net and so we have layer two ways of doing things and what hedera has put has has created and um allowed people to do is the consensus service which is better than a typical l2 system in a typical l2 system you do all the computation off on the side and occasionally you update the mainnet on what happened but what we can do is kind of invert that model we can do the computation on this side and keep all the data there but let all the transactions flow through the main net to be put in order now just doing the transactions is incredibly fast if all you're doing is taking your smart contract calls and you're just passing those calls through hedera to have hedera put a time stamp on it and put them in order and be able to cryptographically prove that it happened that's incredibly fast and so what you do is you use an app net using our consensus service you use the app net to do the actual logic and to store the data and then pass everything through the main net so that you get the trust of the main net on it and so that is sort of a different approach than l2 l2 approaches would also work with us of course you can always use our file system to store some information and update it only occasionally or have a smart contract on us that you only call occasionally to update from some smart contract running on some other network i mean some local private network you can always do that but hcs gives you another way of doing it and so you can run a smart contract on us or you can do traditional l2 systems or you can do the hcs which gives you incredible speed it also gives you privacy in a smart contract as traditionally written you can't have any secrets a smart contract can't know a secret private key that is kept secret because of the nature of how it works but if you're doing this on an app net and you encrypt everything flowing through hedera and the app net is permissioned you can absolutely keep things secret and so you can get some of the benefits of a smart contract that's public with some of the benefits of private code running and so that's what we're doing so it's not that we don't have smart contracts they're not they're not they haven't disappeared they're still here and then as the whole world is building ways of making them better we also have have ways of making them better and we can do them better the same way other people do but we can also do them with the consensus service and so you have a whole range of choices and which one should you use it depends on your application all right choose your own adventure sounds good

council members readiness to announce their membership and therefore to start their initial three-year term well um so i'll answer that but i also want to take an opportunity to sort of update the community on the process i've talked about this in the past um and we have made another improvement to the process so let me describe that and then i'll i'll answer directly a question we now have a separate admission date in other words when their membership a new council member when their membership term actually starts when they're actually admitted to the council in addition to an effective date so the effective date is when an agreement is signed in other words we have a contract where they're effectively joining the llc they're becoming a member of the llc we've signed that i can now counter sign it that's what's new you know the prior when we talked about this last i described the process where they would sign and then i would counter sign in the moment i counter sign they'd become members and it would be announced well that created other problems and so we now have an admission date separate from the moment in which i sign or the effective date i can now counter sign we can have that behind us and then when a new council member decides that they're ready to publicly disclose that they're a council member that's the admission date that's when it becomes uh the case that they they're they're part of the council in a meaningful way it's at that point when the three-year period starts so um why would they want to wait you know the in the experiences i've had it revolves me around their readiness uh in most cases to to talk publicly about their plans not just the fact that they are joining hedera as a council member but um that they have a use case in mind or they're doing something more generally in the space of distributed ledger technology and this is part of a larger announcement it really has nothing to do with them wanting to delay the start of the three-year term you know i i don't think that that matters it has more to do with their own comms program and readiness to to announce to the world not just perhaps not just the fact that they're joining hedera but what that means in the larger context of of their overall strategy and what they're doing but it doesn't always happen you know it's often the case that they sign in the admission date and the effective date will will end up being the same i'm anticipating that would be the case as well so that that's that's the experience we've had so far all right thank you mance for clarifying that ah can i i'd like to clarify my last question before you ask me another question so this is kind of fun homomorphic encryption is fascinating um if you want to run a program on every node in the network and not have the network nodes know what they are running if you want to keep it a secret from the computer running the program that's called homomorphic encryption and it can be done there's partially homomorphic encryption there's ways of just doing certain operations that you can actually keep secret from the computer that's running it and you can always do that but if you want to run a general purpose program like an ordinary smart contract you want to take an arbitrary smart contract in any language and be able to run it in other words if you want it to be turing complete which means you can do anything then you'd have to use fully homomorphic encryption to keep it a secret from the computer that's running it and if you want to do that i actually worked on this 20 years ago i was doing research on this um just recently a few years ago someone actually invented it and actually got it working it was immensely exciting i'm really excited about fully homologous encryption however to run an ordinary little smart contract call would take many many hours or days or months even on as on a computer to do it in a fully homomorphic way no one knows how to do that practically right now now there are ways of encrypting databases where you can do just a certain number of operations and still hide it from the person running the database in the computer running the database or there are ways of doing just certain operations like that but if you want to run general purpose programs and you want to keep it secret right now what you have to do is run it on a computer where that computer is keeping the secrets where the computer can see the secrets but it doesn't tell anybody else and so that's why you would use hcs for that uh you could talk about doing partial versions of that at the native layer of hedera but it will never be able to run fully general programs until we have fully homomorphic encryption working fast and i don't know if that will ever happen but it certainly hasn't happened in the last few years so that's what i wanted to explain is what i was talking about is fully general turing complete programs just humanity has not yet figured out how to do it there's some reason to think we'll never make it really practical but um yeah today we can use hcs you can get the exact same effect uh in that way which has been incredibly fast super fast and completely secret okay so i just wanted to clarify all that thank you um okay we'll keep going leemon but we'll switch switch gears a little bit do you believe hedera

had been using the hashgraph platform would the recent russian hacking have been obviated and i think by this they mean the solarwinds attack okay so let's just talk about hacking in general so hacking in general is involved in stealing information or in going in and changing information on a computer or in going into scada systems scada is things like power grids and railroads and dams and water you know infrastructure control where computers are controlling those things hacking can get into those so hacking is kind of a broad thing and ledgers are not a panacea a lot of these things have nothing to do with ledgers so if someone is stealing your information ledgers don't really help you can put your information on the ledger and encrypt it but then the security isn't coming from the ledger it's coming from the encryption you did so ledgers don't really help with that i mean public ledgers uh private ledgers of course can be kept private but public ledgers don't really help with you know somebody stealing information if if you're talking about control systems for for scada then ledgers don't themselves help what you really need to do is have strong authentication when you log into the dam and you try to open up the sloop skates but that might involve public key infrastructure where you sign your transactions or your commands with a with a key and that might involve strong identity systems and ledgers can play a role in that they can help us build up strong identity systems and keep track of of like revocation lists will have your keys been lost you can just report that they've been lost and now nobody will ever use them again and with a ledger you can make sure that information goes out immediately and very fast so there are ways that ledgers can be part of a strong identity system and i think the planet needs a strong identity system and we'll get there and hedera will play a part of that uh and and is already we're already involved in standards for identity on on ledgers um and for keeping secrets well the ledger itself doesn't keep secrets if it's public the whole point is to be public but you know you can always encrypt stuff that you put on the ledger but then it's not the ledger helping you for preventing people from corrupting information the ledger can keep information immutable or even better control immutability where it only changes when it's changed by an authorized person there a ledger can help unless you lose your keys so if the attacker if the hacker is able to get your keys then of course the ledger hasn't helped a whole lot but it can help from some kinds of attacks so there's there's limits to what a ledger can do to stop people from hacking into your laptop if they can hack into your laptop and ledgers can't really do a whole lot if they can get your keys and so on uh and you could say oh we'll store the keys in a special chip in the in the um laptop itself we'll have a trusted execution environment we'll make sure that that the keys are stored there so a hacker can never get the keys okay but if the hacker can lock and hack into your laptop they can use those hidden keys to sign anything they want which is just as bad as getting the keys so the world of hacking isn't is a big area and ledgers can maybe play some roles at the periphery of it um they're not they're not a panacea and most of what we talk about with hacking really is unrelated to head ledgers but yeah they can they can help somewhat especially in the identity parts of it all right lots of pieces to that lots of things puzzle on

back to mark andreessen i think a couple decades ago and what i would say is that software has already consumed the world this is not something that's going to happen in the future it's happened what's new is that the world will become tokenized that's what's exciting everything you can see everything you can touch and many things that you can't see or touch will be tokenized if it's a product or a service if it flows through a supply chain if it's information of any value then it is going to be tokenized so think of a public ledger as supporting a massive global database of records of information each record is represented by a token these tokens are designed to for economic activity that implies that you can transfer the value of the record from one party to another so what does that mean if we think about interoperability between ledgers all right we're simply saying that the transfer of these tokens needs to be able to take place across ledger so the interoperability layer is transferring enabling the transfer of tokens or these records in this massive global database from one ledger to another it's like moving a record from one database to another so by representing the record as it's spoken we make it really simple to transfer the value of that record from one party to another and because transferring a token means that we're transferring value then then what does that imply it's critically important that we guarantee that the token can't be cloned or duplicated in other words there can only be one copy of the token that exists at any given time this is the difference between a normal database and distributed ledger technology that's what hashgraph and dlt more generally enable that's what we're that's that's the future right the world's already been consumed by software it's about to be taken over by tokens thanks mance and while we have you on a roll talking about vision um do you have you conceptualized what hedera will", "title":

little more general it's a planet-wide utility hedera is a planet-wide utility it will have an effect on every part of the economy with everything of value accessible from the ledger identity will be on the ledger there will be proofs of uh published information on the ledger anyone at any time can carve out you've heard this before for those that have been with us from the beginning anyone at any time can carve out their piece of cyberspace and build and work and play with those that they invite into that into that universe what we're now seeing are the mechanics of how we realize that right we we started with a vision and we knew that we would somehow get there now we're seeing at finer grain detail how all that plays out and again it's all about tokenization the future is a tokenized universe all right thanks man it's planet-wide but also possibly for mars i'm sure somebody will tokenize mars you could already buy a star if you can buy a star you know on paper somebody will tokenize the universe yeah i feel like that might have been a plot of a minions movie but we digress here yeah um okay we will tokenize ourselves right i mean we can we can point to spencer dinwiddie who's already uh going down that path and sort of creating the platform that makes it possible for content creators i i forget what he calls them those that have contracts to tokenize those contracts

features that make hedera the best choice so it's faster secure and well governed and this really does matter so we can do many thousands of transactions a second which lets us charge a hundredth of a cent to transfer a cryptocurrency uh this this matters you can do transactions at 30 cents a piece but you know it's a hundredth of a cent it's it's allows you to do kinds of things you couldn't do before and it's extremely fast and the consensus service lets you harness that speed to run arbitrary code on other networks even even keep it secret but still have that speed in the in the security of hedera and it's well governed these council members that run it that own it that control the road map of it are scattered around the world they're in different countries under different jurisdictions on different continents and different cultures and different fields different markets different industries and so they are check their checks and balances on each other but they're also extremely large corporations that have been around for a long time that know what they are doing and um are not going to make stupid mistakes well they can make stupid mistakes but as much as we can two heads are better than one and the council is going to be the best that we can get for making wise decisions and i said companies it isn't just companies so we have ucl uh we have schools universities uh which gives another perspective and um and we'll talk more about those things so i think that the governance is important the speed is important the being inexpensive is important the um latency um i didn't even say that just a few seconds to finality and it's true finality visiting fault tolerance means it's guaranteed to be finality it's not going to roll back um i have to laugh at the fed this week people are saying that bitcoin did something wrong bitcoin didn't do anything wrong it just had to roll back i think it was only one one block or two blocks there was only one block it's just nothing so fun gets out there bitcoin didn't do anything wrong and and i heard phone about us too that it takes an hour to reach finality nah three seconds not an hour three seconds so lots of fred goes out there but but we do get finality in three seconds and we do uh have finalities right it's final you never have to roll back we never have to say well you thought you got the coin

obligations we've already told the the you all the market uh what those obligations are we do expect that the council members who are responsible for treasury will eventually release all of the tokens from treasury but it's up to them to govern this and they will decide when or if it will happen outside of the contractual obligations we don't have a set in stone time frame for the release of treasury and it's for that reason when we publish those documents that many of you have seen we only show what the contractual obligations are so um the again the expectation is that treasury will eventually totally be released to the market there is uh no thought about what that will be beyond what we published in the contractual obligations and it's up to the members to govern that and decide

think the arab evolved so every nation so far that has talked about cbdc has talked about a model where they run their actual currency the balances of the currency on a private network run by that government um but but the whole point of doing it is to then be able to interoperate with other ledgers and so what you would imagine is that you don't have the balances of the of the us dollar currency or whatever running on hedera i mean you could do that and maybe there's there's a nation that someday will say they want to use a public ledger for that but that's not typically the model people talk about right now you would imagine they run their own um their own one on computers that they run but the whole point of doing it would be so that it could interoperate with people like hedera and so that you could have markets and stock markets and selling and buying things and transfers of things happening on hedera using that token from that private network run by the government and so that's typically what you envision and and hedera i think has a great role in this because hcs gives you the speed so that you could do that and um hedera um has very low costs and i think is going to be a very natural thing to be using for things like markets where you want to be buying and selling things using the tokenized fiat uh as opposed to tokenized fiat itself being on hedera though of course you would have wrapped tokenized fiat on hedera that's how how the tokenized things would interoperate with all the different ledgers and so i think that there will be playing the

interesting that one of the world's largest law firms who makes their money by billing labor hours has created a product right uh dla piper has gone to market with tocco which is a product offering it's a platform it's not your sort of traditional uh way of making money inside of a law firm so i wouldn't i wouldn't say necessarily that i expect their business models to be disrupted i mean maybe it's the case in some verticals but i think that the council members are with us so that they know how to to change their models if needed and to take advantage of this emerging market this emerging uh space that we're in so i i view it as a very positive thing i think it's all good and yes i would expect um new models to to pop up in every vertical and all enterprises all businesses will end up

"start_time": 3006.0, "text": "um again maybe more of a clarification on uh on hbar it's my understanding that to secure the network in an environment where nodes can be added freely hbar must have a minimum price which makes it uneconomical to acquire sufficient h bar to disrupt the network what in your view is that minimum price and how likely is it that it will be achieved taking into account that hedera services are quoted in u.s dollars it's not exactly a minimum price what it is is that it should be hard for an attacker to get a third of all the coins in the world and this is after we've released all of treasury so before we released all treasury they'd have to get a third of all the coins in existence so until we've done released it they can't get a third after we released a third of the coins they could theoretically get a third but they would have to buy up all the coins or you know a third of the coins in existence and in order to do that they have to go out and start buying but the very active buying makes the price go up so the price doesn't have to be high today the price just has to be such that we believe it would go up a lot if someone tried to corner the market on it and then the cost to corner the market on it has to be balanced against um how much profit they're going to make from this scam and so you know if they can only make a million dollars on the scam then it better not cost them more than a million dollars to buy a third otherwise they just won't do it uh and so you'd have to find a scam that they could make a lot of money so much so that it's worth risking it by spending less than that amount of money to corner the market on h bars that sounds hard even today um that sounds hard to do and we haven't even released many of the coins but you know even today i think it would be extremely hard to corner the market on each bars for one person to buy all the hbars so that's what we're talking about um it would appear that that hvars and even other tokens out there would be hard to go buy up a third of them right now so hopefully that will continue to be the case or become even more the case yeah i'm just going to piggyback on that for just a moment the network is secure as long as the nodes are permissioned and that doesn't mean it can be restricted or has to be restricted just to the governing council notes there can be thousands of permissions nodes and the network would be secure independent of of the whole topic that leemon just addressed yeah so we're totally secure as long as we're permissioned we're also totally secure before we've even given away a third of the coins because then no one could get a third of the coins and then even when we get away all the coins and we're not permissioned we're still secure if it's harder to get a third of them you know you cost you more to get a third of them than it would that you would make on your scam so multiple levels of security there and i'm sorry just one more clarification when when we talk about permission we're not talking about people for getting you know going through kyc to create an account on the network we're talking about the nodes that are uh participating in consensus as long as those are permissioned then then we're secure yeah i heard someone understand recently thinking that you had to be permission and do kyc to get an account on hedera that's not true you get it totally anonymously and there's even places you can get it for free um many of the wallets will actually create an account for you for free and totally anonymously

legal system to enforce that so you wouldn't do that you could under a first to invent system use it to prove that you invented something so it used to be that people would invent something they would

outlined here and i would refine it in the following way when we choose what to develop for the platform we are choosing features that can be used to enable a large a large range of products not just a single product typically i mean we are a platform in that sense it's meant to be horizontal to be able to support lots of different use cases while we don't tend to directly develop products in any specific vertical we understand that the community will develop products in many verticals including defy and i do have first-hand knowledge of multiple projects in the market that are doing exactly that so i think it's fair to say that they will be making announcements as those projects mature uh but as an organization what we're not focused on is a single vertical but enabling the community at large to do the kinds of things that they want to do including the ones that you've you've just raised in this question so stay tuned all right thanks mance and the next one i think is top of a lot of

things online it seems like we're still a long ways away from having trusted and impartial voting on a distributed ledger oh you're right so um there are ways that ledgers could be used in the voting process and eventually it could be used in a lot of ways but there's a lot of things we have to do first so we're not ready as a society to be doing this and here's just some of the things to think about in the complexity of the security here you can imagine that maybe each local precinct stores a hash of their votes on the network just so that they can't later change it without saying it you could use something like that right today but it doesn't bring a whole lot of value but it has some value for auditing to prevent you from telling two different people two different answers or changing your answers after the fact you could do that today but what you're really thinking about is you know having our whole voting system i just push a button on my phone and i vote and it's on a ledger and it's unchangeable and we can trust it right there's a lot of problems with that there was even a publication from mit i saw recently explaining a lot of the different problems but there's a huge number of problems with that and we'll get there but not today so to do something like that here's just some of the issues you have to worry about we need a good identity system which at a bare minimum in the united states would mean that you need to have the um driver's license being issued by the government on ledger you need to have the social security card being issued on a ledger you need to make sure the important thing is that if you move out of a state you get removed from the voter rolls from that state or if you leave the country or a deceased or any of the different ways you could leave the system you have to make sure that that gets updated in the identity system so it can't just be an identity system for a piece of the country you'd have to have absolutely everyone in the country in an electronic identity system that is updated and guaranteed and and you'd want that to be on the ledger or or the ledger be able to read that and know that it's getting the truth so just there just even before we can start you have to do that then you have to make sure that voter registration is secure then you have to make sure that the software is secure and this bothers me right now in places that use electronic voting machines which is pretty common what if there's a bug in the software lots of hackers hacked into such machines now at the moment i'm not aware of any particular bugs in the machines that are in use but there are there have been concerns a lot of these machines will spit out a receipt a paper receipt and that we can later count those that's a good idea what you want is maybe it prints two receipts and one goes to the user and one goes to the to a bucket that holds them that we can count if we need to or something there's there's lots of yeah but you have to print them at the same time if the printer prints one and then prints the other you can hack it so it prints different things so you want to use carbon paper or carbonless paper to do them both at once so you want to do something like that and then there's the question of what how do you actually know that your vote was counted correctly but maintain privacy so people like chomp have invented all sorts of cool math to do this where they give you a receipt at the at the election that looks funny and you can later check online and it shows you something on the screen that looks funny on your computer screen but then you take this clear plastic with black squares at you as your receipt and you put it over the screen and you can see how you voted and see if it was recorded correctly there's lots of really crazy things like that that you can do and then you have the problem of bugs in the software if you're gonna vote from your phone you want that's really far away at a bare minimum you need to have the program have a math proof that it is correct that can be checked by a computer proof carrying code it needs to go into a secure chip in your phone not your normal phone chip and that secure chip in the phone has to be able to show you who you can vote for and let you vote on a separate screen maybe on the back of the phone that has an ok button that's just connected to that special chip it has its own special operating system and the main phone only connects through a um a serial connection that's very carefully locked down that whole architecture can be done but nobody's doing that yet uh and that's something we're gonna need for real true security and then you still have the problem of what if somebody is watching you vote and paying you while you're voting to vote for for somebody or maybe they pay you to give them your phone and then they can vote on election day for you how do you stop that i don't know that's actually a really hard problem so voting is a very complex thing auditing we can do today and maybe there's some value to that um but uh but our current system is is pretty secure and you don't want to go to a system that's worse and occasionally one precinct will make a mistake and that affects a few votes but if you go to a system wherever the country is running one piece of software you make a mistake in that software then it affects everyone in the country and that's not as good so we want to be very careful we have a good system we don't want to make it worse and we have to go very step by step but we'll do that

token service in response to market demand so most of this year has been spent determining which use cases are the most important to the market uh we started off with a dozen and we've narrowed it down to a couple tokenization generally speaking including the hts as well as data integrity um we did that in part by looking at how the network was being used and also by just listening to the customers that we were talking to so it became clear at the beginning of the summer that there was a large pinup demand for tokenization services on hedera generally and that takes two forms there's the ability to create a fully customized token of any flavor you can imagine using hcs and an app net the app net of course would be holding the ledger itself and hcs would do uh put put the transactions into consensus order and then in addition to that what you all have seen on the preview net and is coming is hts today tokenization service that makes it possible for users to very quickly spin up an erc 20 like token you know it's it's not an erc20 it's our own specification but it's it's very quick and easy with less customization opportunity that as you would have in if you were using hcs so we have customers in various stages of uh development and interest for both of those so again the simple answer is yes all right thanks for the update vance leemon we have a question

hedera besides the technical support provided by the boost program right so uh another great question and this is uh this is one i've been looking forward to answering so leemon and i are both directly working on a program that is designed to incentivize the growth of the hedera ecosystem generally so rather than exclusively focusing on transactions per second we're going to incentivize the creation of active accounts what we're calling active accounts meaning accounts that have a non-trivial balance of hbar in them over a period of time as well as the creation of a large well let's stick with active accounts so if we create a large population of active accounts then that base of active accounts represents a market for any dapps or applications that would potentially build on top of the hedera platform so we're we're going to incentivize specifically the creation of active accounts in addition the flip side of that coin is that we're going to incentivize applications to provide hbar holders something to do with their hbar outside of making api calls on the network itself so we are focused on transactions per second the creation of active accounts as well as incentivizing applications to provide hbar holders to do something with the hbar outside of merely making api calls on the platform in other words we're building a program that will incentivize the growth of a decentralized economic ecosystem that's that's the goal here right so this is different than simply paying a large staking reward that would incentivize people to lock up their tokens until the rewards end that's not what we're talking about here on the contrary we're focused on providing incentives that lead to a sustained lasting ecosystem that's the goal we're now working with our first few grant recipients on the details of this and we will be providing more information as the program matures you know that reminds me you mentioned we're incentivizing people who will drive tps who create active accounts real accounts with different people owning them and will um give you things to do with hbar on the network i love those three we don't care about fake accounts or empty accounts or a million accounts owned by one person and it reminds me of what happened this weekend did you guys see that it was kind of funny ah sad but um there was somebody who set up a website to create free accounts for you he would pay for it the guy set up the website would pay for you to create an account and it's a great thing he was being generous and and you know whenever someone's generous other people tend to want to take advantage of it and i hate that and so somebody wrote a bot that created lots and lots of accounts and he ended up losing a couple hundred dollars before he turned it off which was sad it doesn't hurt the network doesn't affect us but it's just sad to see that happen to somebody and i was just thinking what's the moral of the story is it you should never be generous no being generous is a good thing what i would say is if you want to be generous be generous that's a good thing but when you write your software put a cap that you'll only be generous so many times per day and that way if someone tries to take advantage of you you'll know it and they just don't take advantage of you very much um so that was unfortunate and that happened over the weekend you may have noticed a whole bunch of accounts got created and then on monday more accounts were being created but this was by a legitimate person so i think it may even still be going on right now but they're just creating lots of accounts and that's also a legitimate person and so we don't mind either of those two but they don't particularly help us either and so we're not incentivizing those if we want to incentivize accounts it'll be real accounts where every account is owned by a separate person and has a lot of hvars in it then they become potential customers for other companies to come into the ecosystem and it builds the ecosystem we want to reward that but these these current things are just creating a whole bunch of accounts you know doesn't hurt us but it doesn't help us so we're not going to reward that all right thank you both um leemon hedera is a public network so it's", "title": "Will Hedera provide financial support to startups?"}, {"end_time":

different parties that are involved so the bigger the project and you know many times the longer it takes and the more phases that there are so i would give coupon bureau kudos for really laying out those phases if you have interest in reading you know the details on how that is going to be rolled out they do have a white paper on their website as well and but you know we've always said we are an enterprise grade public ledger and so as a result you are not going to see um you know you're going to see things that take uh meaningful projects that take time to build and then um have meaningful minds milestones as they deploy and get used out by um a large number of people so we will keep being that drum we want to share those updates and we are always excited to see that progress from our

let me first start by just sort of correcting a misperception hedera didn't choose whether it's a security or or not um we we don't have the authority to choose whether it's one or the other what our view is is that based on the facts and circumstances the sale of hbars and transactions and h-bars should not be subject to u.s securities laws we meaning it's not a security or it's our belief it's not a security we structured it to not be a security we believe that we have a strong basis for that position but ultimately it's going to be a legal determination on the part of the regulators that's not true just for us it's true for every platform in the market and it doesn't really matter what our view is it's the view of the regulators that count now if it's a security then there are a whole set of laws that apply to it that would have an impact on its use in the way that the platform has been designed to use you know hbars but we you know we're confident in our view we've been in discussion with regulators for years now a couple at least a couple years maybe longer and um and and so that's that those are the implications and and that's a little bit of clarification on on our

make a quick buck do it pump and dump and have it go away in a year we went to last generations we wanted to last throughout history this is the goal is to build something real that will be providing

clarity to this the member when commenting on recent lawsuits enforcement actions fundraising strategies and overall activities those were not referring to anything related to hedera those the member was talking about in the industry in the distributed ledger industry there have been enforcement actions fundraising you know various fundraising strategies overall activities etc so it's not the case that they were talking specifically about something that we have done in in the context of this uh the sentence here however they did raise the question of whether hedera is being too conservative in our regulatory stance and our restrictions on certain activities we're pretty conservative and in what we will and will not do one of the features and challenges of decentralized governance is that we have numerous members with different risk profiles different perspectives that operate in different jurisdictions uh so it's not the case that uh there you know that they all have the same opinions and same same views on on anything right and just about any any decision that has to be made that's consequential uh there there's a lot of debate that goes on i view that as a very healthy thing so i would say that it's an ongoing discussion it's an ongoing conversation about how to balance business needs against a whole variety of risks market risks regulatory risks etc and it is a conversation that's worth revisiting regularly regularly and we do so so um you know it came up again in in the last council meeting it will probably come up in most council meetings as we continue to monitor the

very much have enjoyed computer science and and the dlt stuff i'm doing if i was going to stay in computer science i might do things in ai and in graphics and robotics and in jam-resistant communication i've all done all those things if i wasn't going to be in computer science i think i would enjoy any of the sciences physics i think i would enjoy pure math uh just even abstract math it doesn't have useful applications i think that i would enjoy any of the sciences i'd probably enjoy any of the engineering's i would very much enjoy being an artist i think i would enjoy being a writer

do things and be passionate about what you're doing and so given almost anything i think i could become passionate about it and enjoy it yeah so i mean what leemon is describing is is the same for me it's not that there's one particular discipline that is necessarily more or less interesting i mean of course i have some interest in leemon and i have been working on those for decades now but what's

he's done some very cool things both in building his companies and being visionary so you know i don't agree with everything he says but i think a lot of what he does is really revolutionary and have you looked at starlink the numbers on that blow my mind have you looked at the numbers that it cost to orbit for his his spacex stuff is amazing everyone says the tesla is great i drive a beat up old decade old car but if i were to buy a new car i'd probably get a tesla it's beautiful um if i could talk to him i would be most interested if he wants to talk about the projects he's currently involved in i'd be most interested in talking about how to use self-replicating robots to colonize mars i think that it is necessary and sufficient if we can build an ecosystem of robots that can mine and manufacture and assemble and transport and repair if you can build an ecosystem of that where they are self-creating then it's inevitable we'll colonize mars it's almost trivial surely somebody will send a seed and then 10 years later we'll move into the gigantic cities sprawling across the entire planet underneath the ground but huge cities and farms and parks and and everything um if he were willing to talk about something he's not currently involved in i would talk about self-replicating robots that are tiny i would talk about nanotech i think the number one thing that needs to be done to move this field forward which is not moving forward fast it's really slow there was something recently on self-assembling dna being scaled up to larger things which is very cool people have built artificial ribosomes that are very cool but mostly this it's moving at a snail space because there's no funding for it the number one thing is that we should be incentivizing the creation of an insilico replicator by which i mean build a model in a computer of where all the atoms are and simulate it and have this machine in the computer self-replicate and there's lots of literature on how you would go about doing that it's a hard problem but i think that if someone did that it would be a proof of concept that you could build such a thing in the real world and lots of funding would happen and lots of researchers would move that way and we'd have it soon and then everything becomes better computers become better colonizing mars becomes better almost anything you can imagine energy production becomes better everything becomes better if you can build a self-replicator but um that's what i would incentivize so if i talk to him about one new thing to do i'd say little self-replicating robots and if i talked about it with something he's currently doing i would say big self-replicated robots all right leemon i'm going to jump around a little bit only because you

there from earth what it means is that it would be enormous underground cities i've been in the world's largest mall in dubai at least it was largest when i was there it is beautiful there's no windows it could be built underground on mars and you wouldn't even know there's anything different you don't feel claustrophobic it's very open actually all malls are like that there's usually no windows and it could be built underground on mars and you wouldn't even know the difference you could have apartment buildings built underground and you know many apartment buildings have uh courtyards like a square that has all the the windows facing in you could do the same thing the only difference is that the square that courtyard would have a ceiling above all the above all the windows and that ceiling would have lights on it and maybe even a fake sky um and that would be your underground apartment complex on mars and it could be beautiful um and i have also had some ideas i think you really want your apartment to be between two parallel hallways so there's a way of escape if one hallway has problems um but yeah maybe you crawl down into the courtyard or maybe you have fake windows on your walls that are video screens there's other ways of doing it but if people want real trees done in a real courtyard you could do that too giant parks all of that um i actually have

this time um so hedera was you know and the", "title": "Intro"}, {"end_time": 306.0, "start_time": 21.0, "text": "hashgraph algorithm were created out of your vision for share worlds shared worlds can you paint a picture for us of what these shared worlds would look like in virtual reality or augmented reality and would it have any resemblance to ready player one and if so who would you be in such a universe um uh yeah someone asked me what are you doing rpgs or they said d and d i don't play i haven't played dvd but rpgs i usually do the magic guys because that's that's a lot like computer science um but would it look like ready player one short answer is yes so i do think that we are coming i'm really i really am interested in vr and in 3d graphics um especially 3d graphic algorithms and we can talk about fractals and things sometime very exciting stuff i've done work in that uh so yes in some sense we're going to have a future where you have vr like you see in ready player one and you can see in snow crash you can see in tron and you know literature is full of and movies are full of these vr worlds that they show and augmented too but but vr is in some ways more exciting however did you notice that most of those from snow crash to ready player one envisioned that the entire vo world is living on one computer controlled by one person or i think in tron it was one program yeah i think that's true um and that's not decentralized and i think the future really is going to be decentralized the world of cyberspace and vr is not going to be like a website it's going to be like the web lots of websites with links between them and each one run by different people and you will have centralized servers running web worlds you know like second life or whatever you will have that that will happen but you're also going to have the more interesting shared worlds that are decentralized and i think that there's a lot of advantages to having a decentralized world no one computer can crash and take it down no one person is the dictator of the universe that can control everything in the universe you have true trust in it and and of course if you're doing anything like buying and selling things you really want that but even just for games and for having fun it'd be nice to have a world where i know that rules are enforced there might be anti-griefing rules like each player is allowed to take its section of the world and call it theirs and then no one else is able to change things in that section and that rule would be enforced and there'd be no ruler that enforces it i guess minecraft has things called anarchy servers where they claim that there is no rules and no one in charge and yet you find out in the anarchy servers yeah people are actually in charge and they come in and change things sometimes um you could have decentralized worlds where that can never happen and so that is where we're going to go and it will look like these things like uh ready player one except you're going to have hyperlinks and when you touch a hyperlink you go somewhere else in the same world or even to a different world run on a different ledger by different people with different rules but then you need the most important thing that the web has your web browser has that little lock icon up at the top to tell you i think i went to google.com did i really go to google.com or i'm going to something else is there a guy in the middle a man in the middle uh attacking me and so what you do is you need have that little lock that says nope if it i am truly at the real google.com well we'd have the same thing if this is a shared world run on top of hedera you'd have a little lock saying this is truly the shared world run by hedera but that lock how does that come about on the web it's because the one person ruling that website has a public key and they've registered it in various ways but in a decentralized ledger you don't have that the only way to do it is state proofs and so i think truly the future of the vr is going to be a world a cosmos full of decentralized worlds and the only way that you can know for sure and have any trust is that you have state proofs so that when you follow a hyperlink and go to a world you don't have to download its blockchain back to the genesis to know that it's real you can just get a state proof that proves that it's real and it really is them so i am very excited about that i have a quest which i think is great i've owned a whole bunch of vr sets and i've given them all away and now i'm just down to the quest because the quest is wireless which i just think is wonderful and it's wired which sometimes is more wonderful and um and we should talk more about that and talk about graphics and stuff all right well i look forward to the day when we can do these in virtual reality um okay mance next one is for you what do you see in a world where hedera", "title": "What would Leemon's vision of shared

seamless way for them to take advantage of each company that builds the larger community yeah well first and foremost the common part you know the common aspect the common common component to each of these companies is the hbar right i see an ecosystem of companies that all in one way or another use hbar in some cases the companies will only use hbar for making api calls other companies will use hbar for both api calls and also for exchange of value with their customers and there are many ways in which that can happen a lot of different variations of how that might happen but fundamentally we want the hedera platform to offer increasing value as it realizes those network effects where each application that gets deployed on the platform um brings with it contributes to this increasing addressable market by bringing with it um their users their their customer base so we want the value of participating for subsequent users to uh to increase over time with each new application that brings its customer base to to the platform so one obvious contribution is is the customer base we would like the users of the products deployed on the network to become direct members of the hedera ecosystem in other words we view a healthy ecosystem as one that has this growing number of active user accounts on hedera in addition to an increasing number and variety of ways or of uses of the hbar itself so when we're talking about users or active users i'm stressing the word active here a platform that has millions of accounts that have a near zero balance or that don't actually do anything with those accounts doesn't really have a thriving ecosystem of users so i'm not talking about that what we want our users to find value in being part of the hedera ecosystem and the use of the platform and one direct measure of that is whether the users have the need for and are using hbars so the more things that one can do with hbar and or the platform the more vibrant the ecosystem will be so that's that's what i expect that's what we are looking for we're wanting to see not just applications coming to the platform which is happening and an increase in in tps but we're wanting to see those applications find ways to use hbar that drives the their customer bases to creating accounts on the platform which creates a larger uh market for future applications that might consider hedera and and i expect we'll see that all right thanks mance um leaving back to you for this one", "title": "What does it look like when Hedera supports an ecosystem of companies whose users can

as a core part of consensus vulnerable to skewing if so could that mess up consensus no it can't so let's go through this this is really cool i'm not even sure i've talked about this in in talks before so it uses the the clocks in order to ensure fairness and and it uses it in the algorithm however the algorithm is abft no matter what the clocks do so imagine that every computer had a clock that just always returns zero it says the current time is zero which is like 1970 or something um everything still works we still get consensus we still are abft everything works or suppose every clock in every computer was completely random every time you asked it what time it was you got a random number and so half the time it's running backwards still works perfectly you still get consensus just as fast no problems or suppose even worse an attacker a single attacker could magically control the clock in every single computer on the network in that case still works we will still come to consensus the consensus can't be prevented by this attacker we all come to the same consensus we come to consensus just as fast as we did when we had real clocks um these these attacked clocks don't slow down our consensus we can do just as many transactions per second what we lose is fairness in fact what we lose is the high resolution fairness that we're proud of we would still have a low resolution fairness if you submit a transaction and then it comes to consensus takes a few seconds and then i submit a transaction mine will count as later than yours so we do have that kind of low resolution fairness but when the clocks are being attacked if all the clocks are attacked then it is possible that you and i could send out our transactions at about the same time yours reaches the whole network before mine reaches the network and yet mine would count as being before you so that would be the the bad thing that would happen is that um we would have um uh we would not have that fairness anymore if an attacker were controlling all of our clocks however in the real world an attacker is unlikely to control all the clocks they're more likely to control just the clocks than the computers they control which means less than a third we assume that less than a third are malicious you know if a lot of computers more than a third or a third are malicious then we have problems but as long as less than a third are malicious you can guarantee that not only are we avft we come to conclusion to consensus fast but it is fair in the sense that you will get a timestamp put onto your transaction a consensus timestamp that is from an honest computer or it's between the two timestamps of honest computers so you have a very good guarantee that these honest computers that have good clocks or roughly good clocks will give you good time stamps or roughly good time stamps even if the attacker tried to say well i received it a million years ago or a million years in the future if they literally said a million years in the past of the future it can't really mess that up very much so it's only if they could control all of our clocks would you start having ridiculously crazy time stamps on our messages on our transactions the consensus time stamps would be kind of bad and we wouldn't have the high resolution fairness that we're so proud of but we'd still come to consensus it'd still be guaranteed it'd still take a few seconds it'd still be a bft it'd still be uncorruptable uh you would never be able to double spend nothing bad would happen as long as you're not looking at those time stamps and relying them on first on them for something um everything is good and in the real world where the bad guys control less than a third of the computers then if the good guys have their compute their clocks all a little bit off we end up taking the median which kind of averages out all the error and so you will actually get a better answer than any single clock would have given you um so that's that's where we are uh it's it's a beautiful part of the algorithm and the most beautiful part of it is that you don't have to have it uh but it's it's just great because it gives us the fairness very cool amen thanks okay mance the next one comes", "title": "Is hashgraph's use of a median wall clock time, as a core part of consensus, vulnerable to skewing?"}, {"end_time": 964.0,

selected by token holders to secure a position within the block producer ranks on the eos network google cloud will publish a microsite that will highlight their participation in eos's network operations as an elected block producer and this person is asking why google has no problems publishing what it intends to do on eos but has remained silent not true on what it intends to do on hedera so can you share with us what google has shared yeah well so i have several thoughts on the matter but the first one is i think it's just a misperception number one so i do have the quote that uh the same person allen allen day used in our our press around google i'm just going to read it google is a member of the hedera governing council and values hedera as a key partner as part of our council membership google cloud operates a hedera network node and makes ledger data available for analytics alongside gcp's other public dlt data sets today google cloud offers a one-click install for hedera network mirror node infrastructure and hedera has also contributed to google cloud's public data set program google cloud is inspired by what hedera has accomplished to date and looks forward to providing the infrastructure and technologies to support what's possible with distributed ledger technology read more about the partnership here and then there's a link of course so uh in terms of press and and that sort of thing i i think that they're about equivalent but there are some fundamental differences that are going on here that are maybe worth pointing out with eos google as noted in in alan's uh quote there google has to be voted in as a block producer which means they need to lobby the community the eos community to that end so they're going to create this microsite that provides information and and they're going to do things that hopefully will from from their perspective i presume hopefully will result in the eos community deciding that they want google to be a block producer one of the one of the 21. so that's a difference between what they have to do with eos and what they're doing with us of course they are sort of the equivalent they're running a node their council member uh in hedera they're running a node today but then beyond that they are actively participating in the oversight of of hedera they are very active in the council they participate on various committees within the council and we work with them closely so i think it's just i mean i realized that the press with eos was very recent and the press with uh with us has been some time ago was it six or nine months now something close to that but uh if you just sort of objectively look at the situation it's it's about the equivalent except that they are you know deeply involved with

reason we did that was because we found that there was one rare occasion when one of the computers would slow down compared to the rest if you were doing thousands of transactions a second now of course we could have deployed that to mainnet because we're not currently seeing thousands of transactions a second and if one computer slowed down it wouldn't matter anyway the network is a wholly fast but we're we're really really careful to try to make sure that absolute perfection goes onto mainnet whenever possible and so if it's true that there's a rare case under high load where one computer might slow down we don't want to do it and so we just delayed and so we'll do it after tomorrow and we won't have that issue you know we saw what was doing that we fixed it so we are we do a very strong job of making sure that things are good and so what we do i'll just go through the process is that we are constantly testing our code as you write the code you do unit tests and test it and then every time you commit it to github every time a developer commits to github it gets automatically some more tests run on it and then every night a big set of tests run overnight automatically on all the code and then we manually kick off regression test runs that are long and we do them for longer and longer and then we're convinced the code is pretty good we post it to the preview net and everyone can see it on the preview net and play with it and then when it's run on that for a while and we're convinced that it's more good we deploy it to the public test net the stable test net and it runs there for two weeks before we put it on to the main net and so you could say why did you delay from one thursday early in october to one later in october why not just delay it two days ah because we fixed it we had made a change and we always want to run on our stable test net for weeks before we go to the main net we really are serious about testing we go through lots of testing before something goes on main net so if we make a little change then that you know will delay when it goes to mainnet for a couple weeks because we really want to test it well and so we're ultra conservative ultra careful about what we do and so um day after tomorrow we will put it on mainnet and if we get thousands of transactions a second we will not see one computer slowing down on rare occasions so that's a good thing uh so that's what happened and we'll keep you uh appraised of whom we're deploying to stable test net and when we're deploying to mainnet and um and you'll just it's

the community about whether or not hedera would announce five more council members by the end of the year uh 96 of people voted yes but and depending on what day this was done and that's about one every 18 days are you planning to announce all five in one go yeah it's a great question i want to answer it but i realized that i want to add a little bit more to my prior answer as well so this is sort of like a presidential debate where i'm going to ignore you and [laughter] but we'll do that at the end we're going to have mance and lima just yell at each other no so i do want to say one more thing about um the question are any council members developing multiple pocs and then i will answer the question about uh you know new council members one other thing that is worth saying or difference between behaviors between enterprises or large businesses that are building product period including product on hedera and smaller companies or startups is that the smaller companies and startups often want to talk about it long before it's ready to be announced right they they do that because they're trying to generate momentum for the company and interest etc and sometimes it's the right thing to do just for business model perspectives as well so but but a lot of um a lot of discussion or a lot of public-facing uh you know marketing happens in the smaller for smaller businesses long before uh it would for enterprises enterprises are exactly the opposite enterprises will work on products and services and not until they know it's going to be a success and they're going to go to market with it or they have high high confidence that it's going to be a success will they breathe a word about it to the market and so um that that's the difference and while we have a large council and there are a lot of things going on you're not going to see it you're not going to see it until those cut reach a certain level of maturity and the council members are ready to talk about those things publicly that's just the difference in and you know the nature of those types of companies all right now back to the council and are we going to have five before the end of the year so we have five that potentially could close before the end of the year these council members are located in africa europe and the united states in their all household names in their geographies however we've made a change to our internal policy that has had an impact on when these companies will become assuming they do close and and not all have but assuming they do close we've had it made a change to a policy that impacts on when these companies actually become council members so previously we've been signing the membership agreements prior to making public announcements which meant that we had council members that were unknown to the community it was known to the community in many cases that we had additional council members but those members hadn't yet announced their membership you didn't know who they were that resulted in some problems that we needed to address so there is a new policy and the new policy is that potential council members can't join the council until they are ready to make a public announcement in other words i don't counter sign the membership agreement until they're ready to publicly disclose that they've joined hedera the council so we currently have both future council members that are waiting for my counter signature based on the readiness to make public announcement and those that are still simply working through the pipeline and so to be clear given this change in policy we've got our work cut out for us to get five an ounce before the end of the year i just want to make that very clear however in addition to the five that appear to be closest to signature which are the ones that i uh you know knock on wood are are hoping we'd get to signature before the end of the year which we may not we have an additional 12 to 15 that are in the pipeline for next year in addition to to the five that um are the closest and we regularly add new targets to that that council pipeline so will we make an announcement this year of five new names i don't know i think it may be tough uh it's not impossible but it's a stretch given the new policy but you know i think that we will be announcing some council members and the community will be happy with those that announce and those that don't get announced before the end of the year will be coming shortly and you know thereafter into the new year zenobia all right thank you mance okay um so the next one

understand that binary base 2 is used for simplicity but i don't understand why base 10 is used over base 60 for example base 60 seems to be more a logical choice considering its functionality and lastly how are different base different based arithmetics applied and used in cryptography so base 10 is a terrible base why do we use base 10 there is only one reason that we use base 10 it's because we have 10 fingers so whatever ancient a civilizations they would count on their fingers and you get up to 10 and then they would have to go to more digits if they use digits at all you know roman numerals don't even use a base based system that's a word they aren't based anything they just add up little symbols um and then you have people who used hybrid systems so you had the the um the babylonians used base60 the mayans i think used base 20. but their digits they didn't have 20 digits their individual digits were like roman numerals which are kind of cool you add up ones and fives to get one of their 20 digits and then you use the digits in a base 20 system i think it's how the mayans did it um so there's lots of different ways of doing it if you want to be able to divide things up easily it's easy in base 12 to divide something into three or four see if it's divisible by three or four by looking at the least digit in base 10 it's harder to see if it's divisible by three you have to add up all the digits so in that sense base 10 is bad on the other hand we have computers and calculators now so maybe it doesn't really matter um and we just keep using 10 because we're used to it in computer science base 2 is really important because everything is binary under the hood and so we like things like base 16 and even base 8 because they relate nicely to base 2. in crypto we don't really use other bases there has been work of just releasing codes in code groups of five digits you could say that was a base but it's not really a base a caesar cipher i guess is a base it works on a base but really even that is not really about a base really what we use in cryptography is modular arithmetic this is like when it's 11 o'clock two hours later it'll be one o'clock eleven plus two is one well it wrapped around we use wrapping around although instead of going from one to twelve we usually go from zero to eleven or zero to something so you could have a system let's say modulo 15 when you add up numbers you always take the answer and wrap it around subtract 15 a bunch of times to get back to a number between 0 and 14. if you add two numbers mod 15 you could have done the mod 15 on each number first before you added them if you multiply them on 15 you could have done it on each one individually before you multiplied them if you divide them you could have done it individually before you divide them although the division is kind of weird in the modular world kind of ignore division if you subtract them you could do it individually if you raised one to another power you could do mod 15 to the base but you don't have the exponent wrap around mod 15. it wraps around mod 8. isn't that weird so we can add subtract multiply and divide divisions weird but adds direct and multiply and everything is mod 15 but when you go into exponents that exponent lives up here in a higher plane a different realm and in this higher world things wrap around base 8 not base 15. how bizarre and you know what you can't even figure out the number 8 unless you know that 15 is 3 times 5. and so if you knew the 15 but you didn't know how to factor it into 3 times five then you wouldn't be able to guess the eight and you wouldn't know how things in the exponent wrap around and you could use that impossibility or that difficulty to build a crypto system like rsa and that's how rsa works because we wrap around but for exponents you don't know how it wraps around until you know the factors of the of the modulus so that's why we make things wrap around in cryptography and then we have fancier things like elliptic curves and they are exactly the same thing but they sort of work similarly in some ways and and you get into abstract algebra rather than number theory and that's really fun so that's what we do in cryptography in normal math we use 10 just because we've always used it we've always used it because of this that's it all right thanks

regulatory compliant and then more specifically if for example a regulation or court order demands the reversal of a transaction would it even be possible for hedera to comply ah yes so let's talk about exactly what this means to lay your fears to rest if there is a cryptocurrency transfer from this account to this account we do not have the ability to undo that transfer and take the money back out of this one and put it in this one we do not have the ability to undo it it is immutably in our in our history now maybe a court could order this person to then send the money back that's possible but if they know who this person is but it has nothing to do with us this person would actually have to sign the transaction to send the hbars back to this account we don't have anything to do with that we have no ability we also can't freeze this account we can't change the keys on this account uh we do not have the ability to go out and manipulate your account we can't freeze it we can't take stuff out of it we can't delete it we have written all the software so that we cannot do it the things we do have to be signed by the council and there is nothing they can sign that would do that we would have to completely change the entire system this has been what we have done from the beginning to be um trustworthy uh so yeah i've even heard of people talking about hey you should build a chain where you can undo things that's a really bad idea what you should do is make sure that the rules are enforced and the rules that we have are that only the person who has the keys to an account can send it we've even gotten emails from people that say um i had my key written down my recovery phrase and i lost it would you mind recovering it for me would you could you email me my my recovery phrase please oh i'm sorry i can't email you your recovery phrase we don't have it and the entire system is built so we can never get it anyway that's um that's what we have built for the trustworthiness of it so what do we mean by regulatory compliant well lots of examples so like the sec the sec has lots of rules on when you do an ipo when you sell stock so what about an ico what are the rules there well like many things maybe there's a lot of ambiguity there who knows what the rules are and we were hyper conservative we never had an ico just because we wanted just in case the scc decided they didn't like it we wouldn't have done it and so wherever the rules have been fuzzy we have been tried to be ultra conservative ultra compliant uh we didn't incorporate in um an island somewhere with low laws lacks laws we incorporate united states we're headquartered united states we have tried to um be as compliant as we can we've talked at the sec all along told them what we're doing we have tried to be above board we have tried to be very careful in everything we do uh whenever we're not sure um about the rules we kind of follow all the rules we say well no matter what you call us we're following the rules we'll follow the rules as if we were a security as if we were commodity and as if we were a currency we'll follow those rules so that we're kind of safe no matter what you think we are that's what we've been doing gdpr we we have controlled mutability for gdpr which says that if the council agrees we can uh delete a file now this is on the mainnet the the histories are stored elsewhere so you still have the file on mirror nodes but for the file that's on the main net we can delete it if we need to so we had the control g uh gdpr controlled mutability for the files to ensure that you know they don't have bad things in them in that sense that's never been exercised but if a court ordered us to we could do that mirror nodes though are out of our control and the mirror nodes are set up to store things forever that's not our control so that's just on main net so basically what we have tried to do is be as compliant as possible while giving a trustworthy network and and as i said if you have an hbar account that you created and you send to another one that your friend created it will never be undone it can never be reversed and we can never freeze the account or delete the account or take hbars out of the account without your knowledge that's that is what we mean when we say that we are compliant thanks leemon for walking us

computer would be able to find cases to refer to in laws to apply to and would be unbiased yeah so it's back to the natural language understanding problem it's hard to be a lawyer if you can't even read english and understand it that makes lawyerness harder so so here's the bigger problem we could actually write all of our laws in a computer language and then you know the law itself would be readable to a computer but the problem is that our laws often have things like um you must make a best effort to inform your customers of blah blah blah well what's a best effort and if a customer complains well i didn't know that the this giant cereal box only had a little bit of cereal in the bottom you didn't tell me and they said well we put a the max weight of the serial on the box you could read it yeah but i didn't know it's only a quarter full well you could have shaken it and we told you as much as we needed to tell you now does that count as making the best effort to tell them or does it not count as making a best effort to tell them well you've got to take all these things into consideration what exactly did you tell them what exactly were the facts and then what would be a reasonable thing in the mind of a consumer so that if they didn't understand it it was their fault as opposed to if they didn't understand it then you didn't tell them enough so you have to reason about english you have to reason about psychology you have to reason about physics could they have shipped the box and known how much cereal was in it you have to understand a lot about the world in order to interpret this case it is just as hard as understanding written english and so even if we somehow took the law and turned it into computer code it would still be hard for the for the judge the computerized judge or the computerized lawyer to see what happened in the real world and figure out what happened what you really need is a computer able to understand english and if we actually did have such computers then maybe we could eventually go to um not just self-driving cars but self-driving legal systems and that would be nice that would really be nice you could also have lawyer congress people pass laws and knowing what the law means when they pass it because a computer could check it and tell you what it would do in different circumstances uh so so laws are fuzzy because

said to be somewhere between 100 and 1 000 and maybe it's in that range i don't know we have to see what we what it looks like the economics of the coins looks like and how the security derives from that but once you figure out how big the shard has to be then you can have that shard as soon as there's enough transactions per second to support it so when we have a single shard and it gets to twice that number now we can split two shards and each of them have just enough to support them and then when we grow enough uh transactions on one of them to split again then it can split again we can just keep doing that then the ultimate question is how many transactions per second will be done on ledgers on the entire planet in the distant future ultimately you know half the economy is going to flow through ledgers so the number is just astronomical and so the number of shards would be astronomical but um that's the the final end state all right thanks leemon mance will there", "title":

talking to all the conversations are still early there is not an auto maker in the list of the five that are closest to joining the council that we previously discussed but the simple answer is is yes

the story once we once had the entire east coast go down for a cloud provider and um we had some nodes in that cloud but because we were dispersed didn't hurt us and we just kept running a couple of our nodes went down so what we just kept running just fine didn't slow us down our throughput didn't go down our latency didn't go up everything just stayed good and so this is absolutely what we want if all of our servers were on one island and a backhoe cut the fiber to that island that would be bad so we don't do that it's important great thanks leemon we have another question here on explaining app nets in the interest of time i'm going to post some resources in the chat i know we've got some videos and blogs that talk about app nets for so for those of you who are interested in that and

been announced fps is uh the primary debit card processor for australia their big their big name in australia and they are they've already announced that they are building a stable coin on hedera and one of the use cases that they are attacking early on is the use of micro payments as an alternative to pay walls digitally uh and they have a lot of ideas uh very cool stuff rob allen is leading that effort and i expect they're you know it's gonna they're gonna do quite well in in this i'm really looking forward to the results of this so having said that now leemon i'll let you sort of tackle the question in broader terms yeah so broadly i think that we are not going to go to a world with no ads we're going to go to a world where you have a choice so what do you like better hulu or netflix you want to watch for free and have ads or do you want to pay and have a subscription or even a better example what do you like better youtube or youtube you can watch youtube for free if you're willing to watch the ads or you can pay a subscription and not get the ads and so this i think is the world that we need to head to even more we need to give people a choice do you pay or are you watching ads and if you are paying then you need to be able to set it up where it protects privacy and it is possible to do that if you're watching ads there's this huge conflict of interest that makes it hard to have privacy because how do they know a real person actually saw it if you don't really know who that real person is and the advertisers want to know demographics so i think as long as things are supported by ads they're going to be spying on you and that's just kind of inherent and maybe you're willing to be spied on in exchange for free media but if you're paying then you could be you could set it up to have privacy and i think ledgers like hbar are going to allow you to pay for things with greater privacy and that i think is important and so i see a future where you have a choice to what degree do you want to be spied on to what degree do you want to not be spied on and ledgers will help enable that and so that's one of the things we want to enable um i know we're getting close

third of the supply isn't it a problem that centralized exchanges can be hacked as we saw lately with kucoin and others should decentralized exchanges be a priority i love dexes but even centralized exchanges are fine if you have a lot of them and even central even a single centralized exchange would be fine if it wasn't also a custodian the real problem is that there's lots of coins sitting in the exchange so they're actually acting like a custodian if they um allowed everybody to have separate accounts and did the exchanges that way which they could do then you wouldn't have this problem of a single custodian holding lots of coins the solution to a single giant custodian holding all the coins in the world is to have lots of big custodians then they at least have to split up those coins and then have lots of services that don't need custodians and dexes are one and you're right i love dexes but even centralized exchanges are also great they're good too and and so if they do non-custodial work that's great if they do custodial work that's great too as long as there's more than one of them if there's a whole bunch of them we have 100 of them then it's fine that they're doing custodial work that's that's a benefit too and so you know only one of them gets hacked you're fine you just have to make sure that less than a third of them get hacked so i think that we are in the process the world is going to a world with more exchanges more decentralized exchanges even more of the centralized custodial type exchanges and just more custodial services in general and that's what we need we need an ecosystem that's huge that has all of these services in abundance from lots of different providers that can compete with each other on prices and you never have all of them

How are different based arithmetics applied and used in cryptography?\n31:32 What does it mean for Hedera to be regulatory complaint? Would it be possible for Hedera to comply with a court ordered cryptocurrency transaction reversal?\n36:31 Is there a Special Interest Group for synchronization?\n37:59 Why are laws so difficult to interpret?

model sometimes the corporate structure implies a business model but not always for example we don't pay dividends to the members of the llc there is no terminal value in the llc if we were hypothetically to to sell it it were to uh you know cease doing business whatever proceeds or assets there would be there at the end we go to charity we operate very much like a a non-profit in in pretty much all ways the reason we're an llc versus a different structure it has everything to do with corporate liability and the liability protection is provided by the llc structure and so while i understand it can be confusing i mean a lot of people hear that hedera is a corporation uh and they immediately assume what was would normally be the case that the corporation exists to make profits that's not the case for adera we operate and in all respects are like a non-profit we just have the protections of an llc all right thanks vance um leemon we're gonna dive right in um on", "title": "Did Hedera consider a not-for-profit organization model?"}, {"end_time": 451.0, "start_time": 136.0, "text": "uh math theory here today with you so what was the 34 math theory referred to in regards to security oh yeah so byzantine fault tolerance you know where abft where asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance but just byzantine fault tolerance in general is the network will keep running even if almost a third of the nodes are malicious they lie they do bad things and the bad guys control the internet to a large degree uh and as long as they occasionally let messages through we're guaranteed to keep making progress we'll eventually reach finality we'll all agree on the consensus we'll never have some of us having one consensus and some having another all these good things are bft and to do that you have to say more than two-thirds of the nodes are honest and and active at least occasionally active which means that you have to have less than a third of the nodes controlled by the bad guys and the bad guys can control the internet they have to control less than a third of the nodes and that's true of any bft algorithm uh it's true of hedera it's true of any of the algorithms there are some algorithms that are worse where it can only tolerate up to a fifth being bad or a tenth being bad or something but but a third being bad is the worst is the is the best kind of algorithm you could build that can tolerate up to almost a third being malicious uh and controlling the internet and you could say well why is that well turns out it's pretty simple the the proof is pretty simple that if you wanted to build an algorithm that could tolerate a full third it's impossible if a full third are malicious 33.3333 percent you know 34 percent were malicious they could either shut you down and make sure your network never comes to consensus or they could corrupt you and make you come to two different consensuses and you could have double spins and all those bad things and the reason is really simple algorithms that are bft always say we have to have more than two-thirds honest and we have to have more than two-thirds of the computers actually running in order to make progress what if we tried to reduce that and make an algorithm that is happy at exactly two-thirds it doesn't need more than two-thirds what if we wanted to do that it's impossible and here's why if this algorithm is going to be perfectly happy coming to consensus with just two-thirds then imagine that just two-thirds of the nodes are honest so this is two-thirds of the nodes these are the honest guys and down here we have one-third that's dishonest of these two thirds that are honest the bad guys control the internet they could put a firewall in that prevents the honest people from talking to each other so this is one third of the population they're honest this is one third they're honest and they can't talk to each other through this firewall but down here at the bottom we have the dishonest guys and they allow themselves to talk through the firewall they can talk to these guys and they can talk to these guys over here so now what happens the dishonest plus these good guys make up two thirds they can come to consensus and if it's a yes no question maybe they just decide it's yes but these honest guys the ones over here and the bad guys also can come to consensus and maybe the consensus is no and now we come to two different consensuses if you let the group come to an agreement with just two-thirds of us they could come to consensus and they could be different consensuses and you could do a double spend because maybe the consensus is opposite on which of two transactions happen first and so you end up with double spins it'd be terrible so we have to say two-thirds isn't enough for consensus i need just more than two-thirds that prevents the attack i just described but if it takes just more than two-thirds to reach consensus then this one-third at the bottom just by shutting down can freeze the whole network and so either way you build your algorithm that one-third can either shut down the entire network forever just by turning off their computers or they can use their malicious firewalls to make you come to false consensuses inconsistent consensuses which of course is not consensus so either way you fail and you fail in a really bad way and so we cannot tolerate a full one-third being bad controlled by a bad guy who also controls the internet in a lot of fundamental ways so that's why every bft algorithm requires just under one-third being malicious and um because you know you couldn't build an algorithm where it can handle more than one third being malicious if you care about double spins but then less than a third wheel to shut you down any other algorithm is going to have a limit of less than a third for doing bad things so that's the best you can do and that's what we do we do the one third thing all right thank you leemon i know that's a complex topic i'm sorry i should also mention in our youtube videos if you look at the one in harvard it goes through that whole argument in um with pictures so i'd recommend you go look

projects with positive impact within the community yeah well so to date we have given i don't know the exact number but dozens of grants token grants coin grants to various projects for various reasons uh some of them are building products some are pursuing you know other activities but there are a lot there have been a lot of different grants that have already been awarded to a whole range of different projects within the community we have a committee it's called coincom it's the latest iteration of the type of work that we've been doing from the beginning coincom though is a new committee uh formalized just recently in fact we had our first official meeting of coincom this morning and it's the it's the job of coincom to basically come up with policies for these types of grants and what we want to do with the treasury and how to use the treasury to incentivize the creation of usage and utilization of the network in general and focus on models that are gonna survive in the long term you know there's a lot going on in the space of crypto today much of it is not sustainable uh and we sort of recognize that everybody recognizes that the question is how to achieve the benefits that you want while creating sustainable um ecosystem partners that are using the platform and and that's what the function of coin com is and coincom will be using treasury to that in in the

{"end_time": 757.0, "start_time": 582.0, "text": "questions on hbar and how it works so um this first one is i've heard that fees for the network are in u.s dollars so while hbar price might vary the cost of transaction is stable but i've also heard that transactions are paid for in h bars and the cost of transactions will be cut if the h4 value goes too high bringing network costs with it so i'm very confused can you explain some of these scenarios yeah so it's actually really simple i think there's been people get confused about the words what we have done is we have first decided what the prices should be in u.s dollars so 100th of a cent to do a crypto transfer whatever we've decided prices at us dollars and then we have to charge nh bars that's how the network works but we use the exchange rate from the exchanges we have we go out and find what the exchanges are saying the exchange rate is and so the price in h bars is derived from the price in dollars according to the current exchange rate and that updates once an hour so once an hour that exchange rate gets updated and every time you get a receipt from the network it actually includes the current exchange rate in it and we have a file on the network you can download that shows you the current exchange rate and what it will be next hour so you can even know what it will be in the next hour and so you can always see what the exchange rate is it's fluctuating with the market and so the price in dollars stays constant while the price in h bars goes up and down and you could have decided to do it the opposite way make the price in h bars be constant and the price in dollars would go up and down but what we find is that users really appreciate being able to budget for their business and to plan out what things are going to cost um and so we wanted to make the price in dollars be stable but we also could have gone with neither of them being stable and just let there be a market that makes both of them fluctuate we didn't do that we wanted to help out the businesses that are building on us and so and just ordinary people too if you want to be able to budget for what things are going to cost and so what we do is we set the prices in dollars and then once an hour the price in h bars changes so that the price in dollars will be the same and so yes if h bars become more expensive if you have to pay more dollars to get an h bar then the number of hbars you have to pay for a transaction is less that way the cost in dollars is the same and so the real cost to you is constant now we can always change the price in dollars too we have a committee that does that coin coming that this morning i'm chairing that committee we set the prices but we don't change the prices very often i don't think we've even changed them in the last year i think we changed the prices very infrequently the price in dollars but the price of h bars changes once an hour so i hope that's clear we're just trying to set it up in a way to be as convenient for two people as possible so you pay in h bars but it will always be as many h bars as necessary to reach the right number of dollars all right thank you leemon

without going through the scrutiny of acquiring them from exchanges or dealing with that price volatility oh good question so yes you can get them from exchanges of course as you know if you go to hedera.com guide there's 44 different on-ramps that are listed that you can get them from and you can use any of the six symbols nine wallets that are listed there there's nine wallets listed three of them are coming soon to hold them or to manage them um and so i love that and there are custodial services in that list so if you don't want to hold them yourself and manage the key yourself you can outsource that to somebody else which lowers the bar on how much effort you have to put in but you could say i want to go even lower than that and um there are businesses doing that and so for example fair order dot io allows you to just pay them in dollars and they will pay for your transaction for you in h bars and you never have to own h bars or touch h bars so fair order dot io is doing that um i don't know who else is doing that but i imagine that over time we'll have lots and lots of people doing this so if you don't want to hold them use a custodian if you don't even want to buy them in the first place use a service like that that is sort of an even easier on-ramp to use and you can always go to exchanges and buy them in many exchanges they'll just take a credit card which makes it easy a whole range of different ways to um to get the h bars or to pay for transactions without having h markers okay got it thank you leemon um okay mance the next one is for you and", "title": "How

creative director he is the man behind the scenes he makes all the magic happen um all our backgrounds um except for leemon's background last month um you know our we give claudio credit for all of that he does some beautiful creative work and claudio was also in touch with deepak chopra and their foundation who have done some events with him and he's done some beautiful work for them as well and when they started talking about the fact that they wanted to create a resource that could be trusted and you know could not have any single entity own it they also started talking a lot about their governance model and how they were going to try to get content that was vetted and run through sort of a governing council claudio saw a lot of similarities there so the team at cg creative put together hedera as well as the chopra foundation to start having some of these conversations and and it went from there and i'd say for me personally you know i think the aspect that i'm most excited about is that these resources will be vetted and they will also be free and people can participate in any way that they are able to so if you have content that you want to share with the world and that's your gift to the world then you can participate that way and of course that content will be vetted if you want to participate and you know you're a company and you want to encourage either your employees or other users and by thanking people for their content creation those people will be um will be rewarded so and it is really thinking about all the different aspects of an ecosystem and how everybody can participate in it no matter you know what their resources no matter what their gifts everybody has something to contribute and everybody has you know hopefully a way to benefit from this

we want to be at 20 by the end of the year and that's looking very promising it's interesting because we're at a point where we have to decide what to prioritize and what i mean by that is there are a lot of opportunities presenting themselves for usage and utilization of the network and there's work to be done to help make that happen with a bunch of these enterprise customers and at the same time of course we want to continue growing the the council and the goal the the objective we will at some point reach 39. when we get past 20 um we're sort of at this stage well we're at the stage today when enterprises come to us and explore use cases they're not suggesting that we're illegitimate in any way because we quote only have a council of 15 global enterprises right that just doesn't come up the market is satisfied with the governing council as it exists today and trusts it enough to build real applications enterprise-grade applications on top of it and that will only continue to improve with every new council member and so getting the 21st council member adds value but if i'm choosing between adding an enterprise use case versus my 21st council member then i'm probably going to choose adding the 24 or adding the enterprise use case and it's a false choice i don't want to imply that that's really the choice that's being being made but it is the case that um that we do support and there is bd work associated with with usage and there's bd work associated with uh enterprise recruitment and so we are trying to be judicious and make the appropriate decisions as we as we go down this path and and the market responds to where we are today and where we will be at the end of the year so that's that's about as transparent and honest an answer as i can give you will we be at 39 by the end of 2021 i don't know maybe not but if we're not uh it's because we've added a bunch of good enterprise use cases to the platform all right thanks mance and then related to that",

companies that we're working with would ever provide exclusivity to a single platform for the role that they play in the platform that being a you know a managing member uh one of many managing members in a platform it's not in their business interest necessarily to give exclusivity for that role to a single platform so second you know for it to be a conflict of interest for a member would require that that member is somehow benefiting at the expense of hedera and frankly i don't see that happening i don't see how that would happen how would a single member benefit by at the expense of hedera by participating in multiple platforms so the platforms clearly are in conflict i mean the platforms are competing in in many cases not all cases but i mean we don't compete with every platform in the market but we do compete with some and so the platforms hypothetically could be competing with each other um so i would expect and i know that some of our council members are part of the the the you know the governing equivalent of a governing body or an advisory body to some of the other platforms but i'm happy to compete with those platforms that doesn't worry me in fact it's kind of

things happen uh they're in they're terrible well i mean covet obviously is tragic and terrible but if you wanted to to sort of look at the cup half full there are silver linings cova has provided the opportunity for companies in our ecosystem to focus on health care to use dlt hedera in ways that it wouldn't have been used otherwise and the result of that the the you know the larger results of that i think are very positive so we've been working with companies most of this year that are working on different aspects of healthcare in many cases related to covid i want to make a special recommendation that you all go and register for a webinar that is happening this thursday morning and i know zenobia is going to paste the link here into the chat it's an event that's featuring ken meyer who's the founder and ceo of safe health systems and jim nassar ceo of acor they are going to share how they've been using hedera including sharing a demo and a deep dive into their technical architecture what's very cool is that safe is now used they started earlier this year safe is used in production by over 200 000 users today for patient record management population health care automation digital practice and many other things in addition to creating secure health identifiers for end users they prove authenticity of diagnos diagnostic test records in real time and they preserve end user privacy uh they do all this by combining the the features that we have in specifically hcs they're using hcs in this use case so this is the kind of thing that is has been going on uh behind the scenes for many months of course we would love to have talked about it sooner than we are now and i there there are some big names attached to this that i am not sharing just because i don't want to steal their thunder it's not mine to to share so join them on thursday and you'll get a uh you'll get a sense of what they're doing and know some more about their customer list that i think they'll be sharing as well on the on the i do want to comment on the um the d5 craze so the d5 craze is it is really interesting right because on the one hand what we see uh is the rise in ranks of a bunch of new platforms that are in some way shape or form paying staking rewards or dividends or something and that in and of itself by itself is not sustainable i don't think anybody in the market is actually claiming that it is but at the same time it's very interesting it's instructive because um this notion of being able to use treasury like we have and a lot of platforms don't to incentivize network usage but to do it in such a way has some elements of this but to do it in such a way that is sustainable in the long term is what i think is important and uh and if i were going to say anything about defy i would i would give it credit for causing us as an organization to think more deeply about how to use treasury to incentivize long-term utilization and growth of the network with projects and you'll be seeing more about that in the coming weeks and months so it's all an opportunity you know whatever gets thrown at you you uh you you absorb it you learn from it and

about writing down the vision creating the white paper recruiting the initial team uh in 2018 we raised a lot of money we did a lot of software development we introduced the world to hedera we opened the network i shouldn't say open we launched the network in september of 2018. it was closed but it was launched and uh and then you know some partners were able to get access and use it 2019 was really about going to market with the product uh and and we did that we spent the whole year preparing and then we had open access it was also about activating the council in february of 2019 we activated the council uh operationalized it and uh you know set up the the bylaws and how we were going to work together and we're now a year and a half into that and and we're managed we're literally governed by a global council of highest quality 2020 as i've said before is about market validation of the product market fit the use cases in the go to market strategy we are now late into 2020 and over the course of this year what we have seen is um validation of a couple of really important categories of use cases we started a year ago with a dozen and we kept narrowing down and part of that narrowing down is looking at our peculiar benefits in terms of technology and what use cases uh will most benefit from our properties our platform properties and another part of narrowing it down is just what is the market telling us you know what are the projects that are being built and how are they using what we've put into the market you take the combination of those two things we're now at the stage where we have really two top level categories that we feel very strongly about i'll go ahead and say it tokenization is a big one and data integrity as well we are getting to the point where we're preparing to execute the go to market strategy which will be through channel partners it's always been the case that we've expected to go to market through system integrators and partners and

in robin's 31 flavors but we're going to talk about maybe the flavors of byzantine fault tolerance so some people have said that pbft practical byzantine fault tolerance and abft asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance are basically the same can you explain um the differences and um i assume you're going to to tell us what makes abft more secure than pbft no i'm not going to explain why one is more secure than the other there are entirely different kinds of things so if i say alice is tall and i say bob is old alice and bob are particular people but tall and old are things about them so in the same way pbft and the hashgraph consensus algorithms are consensus algorithms but bft or abft are things about them and so they're entirely different kinds of things abft and pdf2 are entirely different things the way you would phrase it is not which one is better you would phrase is pvft is it abft or is it not abft and you would say about hashgraph consensus is hashgraph bft or is it abft or neither and so the way it works out is that pbft is a particular algorithm it's a very old algorithm it is not abft and that means that you cannot prove that it's going to come to consensus which is bft un unless you make some assumptions about timing on the internet so asynchronous bft means that you don't have to make any assumptions about timing practically what it means is that if the attacker can interfere with timing on the internet they can make pbft be very very slow and they've been papers have been published about how that works because although it's bft it's not abft so that was a lot of word salad let me say it again particular algorithms for consensus hashgraph pbft let's take something else um like proof of work those are those are algorithms for consensus if you ask is it bft is it byzantine fault tolerant is it guaranteed to have finality and that we will have the correct finality everyone will agree and that no one can shut it down unless you have a whole bunch of people agreeing is it bft then we would say proof of work is not pbft is hashgraph is yes so for if you're asking is it byzantine fault tolerant proof of work is not pbft is and hashgraph is then if you go further and you say well there's an asynchronous bft so we can handle ddos's attacks we can handle the internet having bad firewalls doing malicious things is it resilient to those sorts of problems then the answer is proof of work is not abft pbft is not abft but hashgraph is abft so that's how they compare abft is a property of these things bft is a property of these things but the things themselves the algorithms themselves are proof of work or pbft or hashgraph so i hope that made sense and it's hard to keep all these things straight i think pbft was a very unfortunate name compared to things like avft but it was so long ago it wasn't wrong at the time it's just nowadays it's confusing because one of them is a property and one of them is an algorithm and it just sounds like they're the same kind of thing but they're different kinds of things um and if you had a good ontology you would know this and we'll talk about ontologies i think in a minute all right thanks

all sorts of things like that and we're an immature industry right now that doesn't have such things so if you use your credit card in a store and they just don't give you the product or they sell you an empty box you get home you discover it's empty or they fail to mail it to you don't know the internet you can go to the store and ask for a refund and they will send you money or you can go to your bank and ask for a charge back and they will send you money and then they will go get that money from the store and then they will charge that store a fine and if the store does it too many times they charge them a really big fine or kick them out and don't let them use the credit card anymore that's how chargeback works chargeback is when you ask the credit card for the refund instead of the store in the world of cryptocurrency you can imagine similar things i pay somebody some cryptocurrency and i don't get what i paid for now if i'm paying for information or something digital like digital ownership of something that's been tokenized then we can use uh smart contracts so we can use hcs and we can ensure that you get what you paid for guaranteed but when we start to use it for other kinds of things like using cryptocurrency to buy something over the internet it's going to be mailed to you it is possible there will be fraud it is possible to do the wrong thing so what are your options well you can always go to the seller and say hey i didn't receive it could you please give me a refund and they could send you cryptocurrency back but what if they're a fraudster you could then talk about having third parties become third-party companies to help you out i love this idea as the field matures i think this is what we're going to see a lot of and there's two different ways they could do it first of all they could do escrow i send my cryptocurrency to the escrow company and then the online seller mails me the product and then i tell the escrow company yes i received the product or they wait a week and i didn't complain either way and then they say okay i guess leemon received the product i will now send that cryptocurrency to the company or they say oh leemon didn't get the product i'll send the cryptocurrency back to leemon and they keep track of how often it happens and they stop being a an escrow service for that company if that company seems to be a fraud all the stuff that credit card companies do and they just eat some of the of the loss as as a loss and credit card companies lose almost a billion dollars a year it's amazing a large fraction of that so that's one way is an escrow company i send in the cryptocurrency and then they do that another way is you could have a a watchdog company where i send the cryptocurrency directly to the store but in such a way that the company sees it you know they see it in the ledger and then if i ever complain about fraud i chose that store because they had signed up with those watchdogs and those watchdogs could then say oh i see that you didn't get it okay the store needs to send you back the refund and they watch whether the store did so and if the store doesn't do it then they go to the courts and they force the store to do it because they had signed an agreement with them or the store had given them a big pile of money to hold just um as a guarantee and they pull it out of that there's lots of different ways it could be set up lots of different legal ways lots of different technical ways so all of that has nothing to do with ledgers but it is part of the ecosystem on top of ledgers that i think we'll see grow over time i think we're going to see all kinds of the equivalent of binding arbitration and things coming into our world and we even put in sort of binding arbitration keys in our smart contracts in our files if you want them you can use them in our smart contracts um not the files um but you can use them if you want them and i think this is important we have hierarchical keys for files we could do the same thing with files so i think as we as an industry start to grow up we're going to start having the things that have already existed in other industries like the credit card industry to help consumers and protect people right now it's a little bit of the wild west but we will fix that and i i encourage everyone listening to this to start companies build products that

this um and probably it's ken ledger's help too first of all i did not say it is impossible for us to build a system to read i just said we don't know how to do it yet it's a really really hard problem to build an ai that can read and there are a lot of problems you have to solve if you want a an ai system to understand a bedtime story as well as a six-year-old we are not there we don't know how to get there there's a lot of people working on it and making some progress but maybe we still need some breakthroughs to get there and it doesn't sound hard guess what it's really hard so the first thing you might want to do is build the world's best ontology that's good you should do that and it's incredibly hard to do and when you do it you've just begun you've just done the easy part so what's an ontology an ontology is how you classify all your concepts so if you're going to have a system that can read books it needs to know that there's such a thing as animals and it needs to know there's such a thing as mammals and it needs to know there's such a thing as dogs it also needs to know that a dog is a kind of mammal and a mammal is a kind of animal that's the ontology it's how they um relate to each other um or i could say pdft is a kind of ledger algorithm consensus algorithm but abft is a kind of property that ledgers do or do not have that's actually the ontology of those things it's the kind of thing they are a ledger is a different kind of thing than a property of a ledger so that's ontology hard to do really hard to do people have spent decades doing it they built some pretty cool ones but even if you had the world's perfect ontology uh you've just done the easy part because then you need to know some facts about those things you really do need to say some definitions dogs have four legs and mammals are warm-blooded and animals like to eat these are things you'd have to type in and maybe what you could do is go to wikipedia and see everything it says about dogs and mammals and animals and type all those in okay that's hard maybe that's harder than building the ontology because there's a lot of information there and so you're gonna have to type in tons of information about what dogs and animals and and mammals are to um build up this really what a definition of what is a dog what is a mammal and what is an animal and that's incredibly hard to do and people spent decades doing that and we still barely scratch the surface and it's really hard and taking all of wikipedia and doing it is really hard you might want to do with machine learning hey why don't we have a computer read wikipedia and enter all those facts great so the first step is we just need a computer that can read oh wait we need the facts to build the computer that can read so can read wikipedia to get the facts that we needed to catch 22. okay but if you manage to do it and get all those facts into a computer that'd be fantastic that's an incredibly hard problem you have solved okay now you've only solved the easy part still there's even more you need to put in the common sense stuff so for example it is unlikely that your dog will eat your entire house probably won't happen um that's just common sense and there's probably not a sentence in the wikipedia article on dogs that say dogs do not go around eating whole neighborhoods of houses there's probably no sentence that says that this is just common sense and you're going to need that before you can read a book now you could say do you really need that actually you do here's a really simple example there was dog food in the house and the dog ate it what is the it referred to is it the dog food or the house there was dog food in the house and the dog ate it it is closer in the sentence to house than it is to dog food and grammatically any noun could be the it and maybe the most likely noun is the one that came right before it the house so how does the computer how does a six-year-old know that when you say the dog food was in the house and the dog ate it that you're referring to the dog food and not to the house well the six-year-old knows that dogs do like to eat dog food and dogs do not typically eat houses there can be exceptions there's always exceptions but generally they don't and so when you write this sentence you just assume the dog was reading the dog food furthermore you think about what the author was thinking and the author says you think if the dog if the author wanted to tell me the dog ate the house he would have worded that sentence differently because the author will assume that i will assume that dogs are more likely to eat dog food than house he never would have written the sentence that way if he was thinking that i would be reading the sentence and thinking that way and so you even have to think about psychology and how the author is thinking about how the reader is thinking really deep six year olds do this without thinking about it this is why it's hard to read so we need to somehow get all the common sense into the computer and that's also hard and i don't even know how you do that i don't even know if you could read books if you could derive the common sense from them or from wikipedia maybe you need to build a robot that runs around and is raised by parents for several years to learn i don't know so then the question is do ledgers play a role in all this maybe maybe we can have crowdsourcing of the ontology maybe we can even have crowdsourcing of the facts and the definitions maybe we can even do crowdsourcing of the common sense facts like dogs don't eat houses um maybe and maybe you wouldn't type in that fact you would type in houses are big and dogs can't eat big things i don't know or dogs houses are made of bricks and stone and dogs usually don't eat bricks and stone actually dogs need anything if they're tiny but whatever you type in facts like that so maybe we could do crowdsourcing and use ledgers for these things uh and that might be a useful thing here and i have heard of crowdsourcing projects for entering uh knowledge bases uh which would be useful uh but i would still say it's not obvious that we have yet thought of the breakthrough we need to do natural language understanding so maybe someday i hope so and maybe ledgers will play a role i hope so on that too long answer to a simple question but topologies are cool natural language understanding is cool and it's all really hard and hard means it's a fun problem to work on all right thanks lee men and as we get to the top of the hour", "title": "Leemon elaborates on AI reading limitations and the need for strong ontology."}, {"end_time": 3457.0, "start_time": 3212.0, "text": "you know i know many of you on this call know this um we are the day before and the anniversary of open access which was um a year ago tomorrow on september 16th and so would love to get from both of you your thoughts and and experience and any other things you'd like to share when reflecting on this past year okay well i'll i'll kick it off i guess um it's hard to believe number one that it's already been a year since open access it's flown by what impresses me is that through the course of the year we've been able to continue making progress in general i mean we've added some fantastic council members to the council biggest names in the world we have of the dapps that we are aware of and perhaps there are a lot more there that we're unaware of i mean to for a developer to use the network doesn't require them to talk to us at all right and so undoubtedly there are people using the network that we know nothing about but of those that are using the network we are we know that there are 47 real dapps real companies that are building applications that are meaningful applications across 15 different industry verticals that's amazing the breadth and depth of that in one year is is gratifying right um we also have 47 on-ramps that that we didn't have a year ago so we've made great progress in terms of uh the on-ramps the custa custodians and wallet providers and exchanges etc that sort of thing still some work to be done there but uh really good progress for the first year and we've grown to about 15 tps over the course of the year which if you consider is fantastic it's twice what ethereum is today and if you were to look at ethereum after year one i don't even i don't know what they were but it's many times hundreds and hundreds of percent improvement over what ethereum was after just their first year so we're very happy with uh with the progress that's been made today and the next year uh you know i'm really anxious to see where we are september 16th of next year uh i know a lot of good things that are going on i i'll be you know anxious to see those get closed and announced to the public and do this again a year from now oh i agree it has been a wild year we have seen so many good things we've seen the council grow we've gotten people like google and lg electronics and a whole bunch of others have joined the council in the last year we have seen the network itself get better we added the consensus service a year ago we didn't even have the consensus service uh this was just something we've added and the response to that has just been overwhelming uh everybody wanted it in fact people were even using our currency service as a fake consensus service because they were so desperate for it they were doing little tiny transactions using the memo field just to record things because they really wanted a consensus service and so it's been exciting to see people getting excited about that and over the next year um i think we're going to see some big users of the network big council members joining maybe new features in the network uh i am really looking forward to being able to talk about all the things that i see on the horizon right now for the next year uh it's just gonna be fun to see what happens and this year was a bad year from kova to fires to everything else i am looking forward to next year not having those problems and if if we were able to grow and and mature and build and reach an ecosystem in the midst of all these problems i'm looking forward to what happens next year when we don't have all these problems so this is looking forward to a good year next year

Topics ranged from how we got in contact with Deepak Chopra for the Never Alone initiative, did Hedera consider a non-profit business model, as well as Mance and Leemon's thoughts on the past year since Open Access.\n\nTimestamps for the questions in this video\n0:00 Intro\n0:41 Did Hedera consider a not-for-profit organization model?\n2:16 What is the 34% math theory regarding distributed network security? (BFT vs ABFT)\n7:31 How can Hedera support long-term innovation and reward projects within the community?\n9:42 How are hbar transaction fees managed?\n12:37 How do businesses get hbars needed to pay for transactions without going through exchanges? \n14:18 How did Coro Global (formerly Hash Labs) get a hashgraph license and why not build on HCS?\n16:23 How did Hedera Hashgraph get connected with Deepak Chopra? \n19:00 With the Hedera Governing Council fill all 39 seats by the end of 2021?\n21:58 When Hedera Council members participate in other DLT organizations, is that a conflict of interest?\n24:08 Will non-council nodes be allowed after all 39 Governing Council seats have been filled?\n25:30 How does Hedera keep focused while being able to react to outside market forces?\n30:39 Is there a training sandbox for developers? https://www.hedera.com/get-started\n31:38 Will there be certification programs available? \n35:25 What Hedera tokenization projects are there?\n37:35 Practical byzantine fault tolerance (pBFT) vs asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT)\n41:35 Will DLTs offer a chargeback system similar to credit cards? \n45:48 When and how are Governing Council meeting minutes published?\n46:58 Leemon elaborates on AI reading limitations and the need for strong ontology.\n53:32 Reflecting on Open Access and achievements made over the past year\n57:37

you want to be what specific changes would you like to see in the world regards to technology travel entertainment or human society in general oh cool we usually start with the hedera stuff and do sort of the fun stuff at the end now we're mixing it up that's nice so let me tell you where i think the world is heading for technology and all that stuff um i do think ai's gonna be really big we're gonna have robots in the near future cars to drive themselves even home robots and also that whole closed cycle of robots doing everything from mining to manufacturing other robots which would allow us to colonize the solar system and i do think that we will see that when we have robots that can do the closed cycle then we will also colonize mars and moon and venus is slightly harder it's the most earth-like place in the solar system 20 miles up but um uh kind of short on hydrogen so you need to import hydrogen i think to have water so we'll do that i think that we will have very powerful ai but i'm still not convinced we'll ever have ai that can do natural language understanding in a good way to read the newspaper and understand it that looks really hard but the home robot that cooks and cleans and takes care of your house that i think we're going to have so we're pretty close on that in energy i think we're going to see really interesting things uh a small fusion reactor small fission reactors small modular reactors that are walk away safe i think are going to be a big thing solar and wind will continue to improve and wave power those things will continue to improve the really big thing is batteries i think that we're going to see improvements over the next few years in batteries that might double or you know quadruple or whatever the energy density which will mean all our cars end up switching from petroleum to batteries which would be great and maybe we'll even improve enough to make aircraft switch to electric that's not entirely clear um and they may even have other cool energy things like fusion uh i would love to see it i don't think things like itar will ever succeed honestly but take itar and give it better batteries and make it tiny and you get spark that might succeed or sheer flow stabilized pinch i don't know if that can work but if it works it would be incredibly tiny and simple and cheap for fusion so we'll see who knows what kinds of things will happen um entertainment vr is going to be big ar so you put on glasses i don't mean big ski goggles but little sunglasses and you can just see things overlaid on the world or you can see entirely separate worlds ar and vr it will all merge together that is coming it will be big i think online entertainment will be big esports and things will be big in entertainment and i do think that ledgers are poised to infiltrate every part of the world all parts of the economy will be affected by ledgers and we're going to see that and i'm excited that i'm in a company that's part of this revolution with ledgers i will say though that you didn't just ask where do i think we're headed you also asked where do i want us to be headed um yeah i want us to be heading all those places sadly i don't think we have nanotech coming along very fast i really wish that would come along faster and genetic engineering may or may not have a huge impact i think it's going to definitely solve a bunch of bad problems but it could do things like hugely expend expand our lifespan or it might not it's not clear yet so i hope i hope it will and i hope that we someday get around to putting money into nanotech and actually get that but the bigger picture what do i hope for societies as a whole would be i really would like a world that didn't have war between nations didn't have oppression of governments on their citizens and didn't have between people racism and other forms of hatred i really wish that we could uh get rid of all of that and there are things we can do to get rid of parts of that and we have to be doing that um and then i just said the negative i wish we didn't have hatred in all these different levels we also should have the flip side we should have loved we should be doing things positive to help each other and that is important and anything we can do to encourage that we need to do so i'm kind of fun starting off with a fun question today and i'm glad that we did

if we look at where we started i think that's interesting in september of last year just after open access we had four tps and then in january of this year we had six tps in june last time i gave an update to the council we were at 13 tps and i just looked the other day and i think we're approximately 17 tps so that's 400 growth in network usage since open access our goal is to get to 50 tps by the end of this year but frankly at this stage our true measure of progress is not tps it's the growth in high quality projects that are working with us that will launch you know in the short term or long term so today we're still planning the seeds that will result in high tps in the months and years to come and while it's exciting to watch the tps growth in in near real time which is very cool it's more exciting to see the projects that we're going to be announcing that will drive the tps in in the out years and tps here is transactions per second that customers real people are using our network not what our network's capable of capable of 10 000 but yeah thank you for actually being used as what you just talked about yeah so we we always talk about it without thought that it could be confused and and we've learned over the months that we say these numbers and people say oh that's terrible i thought you could do thousands of transactions per second and yes we can and do or we know we've demonstrated that we can do that and and we've had spikes of transactions per second that measure in the thousands uh very short short-lived but but yeah this is actual usage that we're talking about all right thanks mance okay the next couple questions we got from a few different folks so we wanted to make sure to address them up front and early on in this session um leemon i would want to

people don't use that just um you know just use this bullet software that's out there and get accounts that way and in the future as additional wallets come on board you'll be able to transfer

allowed to participate in the recent fundraising and why sure so hedera has always taken a very careful approach to regulatory compliance this has been reflected in all of our fundraisings to date the staffs were conducted as private placements of securities and offerings that were exempt from registration under the securities act but complied with securities laws um while the saf was a security we do not believe the hbars should be treated as a security but rather as a commodity and however we do not have certainty about whether the sec or securities regulators will agree with that position because of the regulatory uncertainty in the market today and reflecting our governance by diverse enterprises with different risk profiles in this latest round of fundraising we structured the hbar sale agreements to comply with both the requirements for swaps under the commodities exchange act and the federal securities laws both so to comply with the commodities laws all purchasers must qualify as quote eligible contract participants which in the case of natural persons or people may substantially exceed the requirements for accredited investors and securities offerings there's a long definition of eligible contract participant and other requirements in the commodities laws which can be read online just go check it out i can't go through all of that here but for example just speaking generally for an individual to be an eligible contract participant he or she needs to have millions invested in aggregate on a discretionary basis and by structuring the deal as the commodity swap we satisfied both the requirements for the cftc and the sec simultaneously in other words while we continue to maintain the position that h bars be treated as commodities not as securities structuring the sale in this way ensures that the agreements met the requirements both for the securities law's exemption uh if the sec were to uh the agreements met both the cftc requirements and the securities law exemption requirements if the sec work hypothetically in the future to decide that the token is a security and so all of that is to say we it reflects our uh our position you know

the probability that hedera will be a network that serves the market for a hundred years you've heard us talk about wanting to be a hundred year company that in itself is not a metric but it deeply informs our decision process and so as for the metrics there are two top level categories that we measure progress against all of our kpis and okrs flow from these two decentralization and utilization so under decentralization our guiding light is to ensure that the network will continue to operate even if all the hedera staff were to leave the company that's the goal post right and there are two subcategories that we use for measuring decentralization they follow as under technical indicators and operational indicators technical indicators measure code completeness operational indicators measure the maturity of our processes and the transfer of responsibilities from the staff of hedera to the council members so that's how we're measuring decentralization for utilization we look at tps growth ecosystem integration in other words integration with exchanges wallets custodians etc the growth of community tools such as explorers and sdks and the diversity of usage across the market segments in other words the range of projects in our pipeline from startups to small and medium business to enterprise projects all of these measures collectively give us a sense of how we're doing in

consists of the current state which is held by all the mainnet computers and the history which is held by all the mirror net computers so you have the current state that's like your current balance of your account and then you have the history which is all the transactions that have ever affected your account or the current state is for each of the consensus service topics uh what is the running hash right now of all the messages that have flowed through this service and what have all the messages that have gone in the last three minutes that's the current state and then the history is all that isn't that fun the history is all the states that have happened in the past uh prior to that and so the um history is on the mirror nodes and the current state is on the main net nodes and by separating them that way you get a good speed up which is my poor green screen okay as long as you are safe that's all we need to know i i think i am safe but if you see big green arms starting to wrap around me then you know horror movie or something um so uh as i say uh for things like supply chain you end up using both of those and for the mirror nodes it isn't just what we run it's like lots of people run so dragonglass and other people are running mirror nodes that have the history and so you have both and for supply chain tracking that's fantastic and in fact when you do something like supply chain chain tracking you can decide how much of it goes on the main note you can actually store it in hedera files which means all the main net notes keep it or you can use something like hcs topics the consensus service topics and then all the mirror nodes are stored in your history and you can do it either way or you can store the history in the in the mirror nodes but a hash of the current running hash in the main net there's lots of ways you can split things up so you have lots of choices um of how you would do that and and i appreciate the concerns that aliens were attacking

"start_time": 1392.0, "text": "works do i have to pay a fee and h-bar to keep a hedera hashgraph wallet active sure so the simple answer is well at the moment it doesn't we give you the account forever for free um that's not sustainable so eventually we'll have the expiration and here's here's the thing you might really be worried about is am i going to lose my account because when i ask it what its expiration date is it's now in the past i created it you know more than three months ago and my expiration dates in the past so first of all don't worry we are going to implement expiration but when we do you kind of all get grandfathered in everybody's account will have its expiration date dates set to the future of when we do this change so you'll get a few more months beyond whatever date it is that we implement the change when we turn it on and we turn on expiration all the current entities the accounts and the files and the topics and the smart contracts will get their expiration date pushed into the future by about three months everybody will get pushed a different random amount so we don't all expire on the same day and so it'll be pushed through the future so that's the first thing is um you don't have to worry that you're gonna just suddenly have it be lost we will spend a lot of time messaging out hey we're about to turn on expiration and then you'll have some months to to renew your accounts then going forward in the long term what will it be doing is you will be um the account has an expiration date and at any time you can pay some h bars to extend it and then the expiration date becomes later and so as long as you keep doing that it never expires if you forget then when we get to the expiration date the account is holding hbars it's about to expire what will happen is the account will extend itself it will use some of the h bars that are in it to extend itself and then that will keep happening it will periodically say okay i'm up to my expiration date again and it will automatically extend itself and so you don't have to worry that it will go away as long as you keep a few h bars in it and because because it's really cheap if you just put a few dollars of h bars in it it lasts a long time and so you have that automatic self-renewal someday when the account it has nothing at all in it no hbars whatsoever if it reaches the expiration date then it expires and we delete it and it doesn't exist except it really does for another week uh what we'll really do is we'll just kind of freeze it and sort of put it in a trash can for a week and so it'll stop working and maybe if you weren't keeping track of things you'll notice it stopped working during that week and you still have a week to uh resurrect it pay the pay the fee to to make it be extended but at the end of that week then it really does go away and at that point you didn't lose any hbars because the account was empty anyway but if you want a new account you'll have to create a new account and you'll have a new account id so that account id is forever retired and you don't have to worry about somebody else creating an account with your id it's not like a domain name with your website's domain name expires someone else could get it and stand up another website with your name um your id is yours uh until it expires and then nobody gets it so it is unique to you nobody else will ever be able to get it so that's how exploration will work um we're not um we'll do it eventually i'm not in any particular hurry to turn it on uh but you know if we left it off forever then eventually it'll get clogged up and have a trillion old accounts lying around and so we will turn it on at some point and that's how it will work got it thanks for walking us

person would also like to thank you thank you thank you for your tech and business genius that gives them hope for the future of humanity well you're very kind um i appreciate that uh so we have um sharding is when you have one network and you break it up into pieces and each piece works independently and stores different information but then they sometimes talk to each other so if you have an account it would only be stored in one shard and if you want to send from an account that's in this chart during the account that's in this share then somehow the account the shards have to talk uh and and you do this to make things faster of course you wouldn't do it until you've exceeded the speed limits of a single shard it's always better to have everything in a single chart you don't pay that overhead of communicating between them and so right now we're a single shard and someday we will implement sharding and we'll have a bunch of shards and basically we'll do that when the tps traffic on us is um is is you know getting close to our limit then we'll go to more shards now as matt said you know our limit is 10 000 and we're seeing 10. so yeah we're a thousand fold away but we're growing rapidly in tps usage and so i do think we'll get to uh we'll get to 10 000 pretty soon um and so at that point we want to have shards yes i've worked out exactly how all the sharding will work and the important thing is you will still have finality that is important for sharding not only that it will be bft which means there's guarantees it will come to consensus you can't stop us from coming to consensus we'll all come to the same consensus math guarantees of bft and it will be a bft asynchronous bft which means it still works correctly when people are doing ddos attacks and when there are malicious is slowing down packets arbitrarily long and all that stuff so we have an abft algorithm for how we do sharding and um and we haven't we haven't implemented it we haven't written it up and published it uh we'll do that at some point um the proof that it's avft is very um very simple you can just look at it and see it because because it takes advantage of the fact that within each shard you're a bft and it turns out that if you know that each chart is abft it's not all that hard to create a protocol between the shards that will be abft and so we have all of that we'll write it up at some point we'll implement it at some point we'll use it at some point uh i'm just not really um terribly in a hurry to do so because our tps is going up fast but until it reaches the limits our real usage tps is going up fast but until it reaches the limit of tps of the shard there's no need for more shorts but we will do that and if we keep going up fast the way we are then you know we're going to get there in a year or two or whatever and we will um we will do sharding i can't wait that'll be fun just just one clarification on that it is that today we're throttled to 10 000 tps we haven't yet met or demonstrated the the limits of what we can do within a single chart yeah i should say that too uh there's a lot of tuning and things that we can do um even checking signatures on the gpu instead of the cpu uh we can do millions a second on the gpu of signature checks we're not even doing it because right now yeah we do ten thousand we're only getting ten so you know we're a thousand fold more than we need we're not even bothering with that there's a lot of things we can do to speed up our limit so yes when our limit stops rising and our usage reaches that limit or gets close to it at that point we'll go to shards got it thank you both okay mance people want to hear about use cases what is", "title": "Where is the proof that the sharded Hedera network

to adoption well what we're seeing i mean we introduced the tech a year ago into the market and we didn't really know exactly where the traction would come you know what the use cases might be that we would see over time as the industry began to understand this is something very different than what they'd seen in past if you go from a dozen transactions per second to potentially 10 000 tps then the use case is potentially going to be different than what you've seen and over the past almost a year now what we've seen is a lot of interest in really three categories of use cases one is immutable audit log for data sharing the idea here is a category simply that it's it's used by multiple organizations that are coming to agreement on a shared view of the data generally speaking number two is proof of action uh as it's almost as a service think of it like a service and in this case hcs that their consensus service service is is being hcs service is being integrated into existing workflows to record in real time the activities or actions that are being taken as part of that workflow ad stacks is a good example of this by recording in real time when end users click on links that result in advertising impressions another example might be recording when users make requests to have their pii their personally identifiable information removed from a database these kinds of activities and

down in australia for a general tokenization example we have dla piper they're a great example they're focused on tokenizing real estate assets and the related you know in related we see demand for the use of hcs uh to implement a token bridge for interoperability across token networks so those are just a few uh sort of the major strokes the broad strokes of what we've seen sort of get traction

value of hbars versus the cost of hcs transactions what happens to the cost of transactions as the price of h bars goes love up question so we are different from i think every other ledger out there uh i think we are the only ledger that takes this approach and and the problem you're describing is a real one if you use a ledger and you pay for your transactions using the currency of that ledger then if the price of the currency doubles the cryptocurrency doubles then basically the cost of using a ledger just doubled uh that's horrible what what businesses want and we've been talking to them they want predictable pricing so what we have is something that we keep hearing from customers they really like you pay for your transactions like the hcs messages you pay for your transactions in h bars you have to i mean that's just for technical reasons every currency every ledger has to be paid for with its currency but what are h bars well h bars of course are just our cryptocurrency and the price floats up and down and it could double or have or whatever you know you could do anything and if the price goes up you'd say ah then everything gets more expensive except if the price goes up what you mean is that when we trade on the exchanges people are paying more dollars for hbars we have a computer that goes out to all the exchanges and pulls them um once an hour and says what is the current price of hbars it takes all of those and then takes a median and it's a weighted median according to how much traffic is going on in those different exchanges and so we get this price of h bars this exchange rate and then our exchange rate tool gives that to the hedera network and if the price of h bars in dollars doubles it becomes twice as expensive to buy an h bar then we start charging you half as many h bars to do a transaction so that the cost to you is constant this is a powerful concept maybe eventually everybody else will start copying it because i think right now we're the only ones doing this if the price of hbars doubles then the number of hbars you have to use to do something gets cut in half and it balances out and the cost to you becomes predictable and businesses of course and individuals care about having low prices but they also care a lot about having predictable prices and so we do both we have incredibly low prices but we also have them being

in enterprise usage of hedera to provide security and speed to the range of supporting technologies required to facilitate a distributive workforce i am asking the question from my context as a u.s air force officer who has seen drastic and i believe somewhat permanent changes in the last few months as to how we conduct our work yeah well thank you for the question i assume that you know that leemon and i both are ex-air force officers uh spent a lot of years both of us working there for the for the air force i'll try to be brief here so yes dlts are ideally suited for a lot of use cases in industry that might help with the current situation just to rattle off some ideas reputation systems that enable employees to take their reputation scores from one job to another which sort of flows into the idea of decentralized identity and the ability to to take your credentials generally speaking with you from from role to role uh decentralized markets for sharing the sharing economy like a decentralized uber or airbnb or upwork these are ideas not just that people have talked about in the context of hedera but in the context of you know the the dlt industry generally micro payments for incentivizing people to do certain kinds of activities or for sharing their data proof of action as we've already mentioned is is something that there's been a lot of interest specifically with us and um you know there are just a lot of different possibilities just a general statement what we are expecting and seeing some of is the improvement in workflows within existing organizations and on existing products um they're really two categories you could you could break the world of dlt use cases down into two categories those that are designed with dlt in mind from the beginning in those products and services that already exist in the marketplace today that are trusted and are being used and the addition of hcs or the use of hcs in this case is trust plus on top of what's already there and when we think about enterprise it's heavily i wouldn't say it's heavily weighted but there are a lot of examples on the enterprise side where you can add an additional layer of trust that doesn't already exist it makes it possible for those enterprises to um to improve their product and service offerings compared to their competitors so you know you get both and uh and we

and this time i don't know if we're going to get to all of them because we have a lot but we will try to make sure we address some important ones and then also have some fun ones to wrap up with and

weeks but i i want to also say that in addition we've partnered with a developer of one of the top wallets in the industry in the crypto space and they have agreed to make the transition from a hedera wallet our hedera wallet to their wallet seamless that means that in the future relatively near future when their wallet rolls out with support for hours you will be able to use your 24 word passphrase to add your hedera account to their wallet and you will be able to keep your same account number i know that's important to a lot of people understandably and so we will continue to maintain the hedera wallet until the community has been given a chance to migrate to a third-party wallet so over time we will maintain the wallet there'll be plenty of time to migrate to uh to another wallet and we will provide a lot more details about this in the coming weeks all right thanks man limit next one is for you", "title": "Can you address issues with the Hedera Wallet?"},

depends on how you're defining your terms so a core central ledger has some limits on speeds but then you can have side chains inside ledgers and you can have shards within your ledger and you can have aptness using the consensus service and there's all these ways of having outsiders doing some of the work and of course if you do that if you spread over basically lots of different networks then you can do millions or billions or trillions or quadrillions per seconds however many networks you stand up and so uh all of those things will happen we will of course do that too just like other people do it so you know they're saying well using layer two solutions or sharding or something else we can get millions that's true now of course it's only for certain transaction patterns if every single transaction is is touching the same account and you need to have the balance updating and be aware everyone being aware of it instantly then you start slowing down no matter how you try to spread it out but as long as things are kind of spread out well then you can split them across shards or across side ledgers or across independent ledgers that have interledger communication or across app nets with hcs and you can get as high of a speed as you want so you always want to look at exactly what we're talking about when we say transactions per second it means lots of different things

enable you to do um decentralization decentralized trust to allow you to do and disintermediation to allow you to do privacy to allow you to do all the things that you want to be doing for the whole

for anyone to be involved you don't have to be a major bank or a major company to do something that anybody can do it anytime they want to very cheaply very fast very easily that is why we exist and

transaction would include a hash of that list of events so that you can prove in the future that's really what happened and then the transactions are what go into hedera that's the number you just reported um yeah 200 million is pretty cool in the last 10 months we've had 200 million transactions and those are completely independent things that flow through the network they reach consensus and they're operated on and then if you really want to get confused if you look at our actual underlying algorithm we have all these math terms one of our math terms is event where you take a bunch of transactions and put them inside of an event that is even more confusing because it has nothing to do with an adsdax event so you might take several ads accidents to put them into a transaction and then put several transactions into a hedera event and then those go through the consensus algorithm um so it's just good to keep track of it all the important thing is that we're talking about lots of throughput on hedera 200 million in the last 10 months and one customer is doing or one user is doing an amazing amount of things in the advertising industry with a billion events that they have now

and in recent months the swisscom blockchain organization has undergone structural changes that resulted in their leaving the council had nothing to do with the relationship with the council or anything it had everything to do with the structural changes taking place within their organization i think also maybe it's worth noting that in our february council meeting the council approved a set of criteria for membership that swisscom blockchain as an organization does not meet today we certainly did not ask them to leave the council but under the new guidelines they would not qualify today as a new potential council member i should say that kamal yusefi and the whole swisscom blockchain team contributed significantly to hedera and in its you know first phase of creating and growing the

caught and they will get caught because the way transparency works but even so we wanted to make it really hard a very high bar like more than 12 of you more than a dozen companies have to um collaborate in order to do anything evil which would imply well you need more than 36 members if you want more than 12. and so uh what we said then is okay we'll just pick our nice round number around 40 people will be our our our council and then we realize well you know it's kind of convenient when a council gets together in votes if you don't have ties so an odd number would really be nice so maybe in this this round 40 we won't do that we'll do like 39 or we'll do 41 something like that so we we thought it might be nice to be odd you don't have to you can always have tie breaking rules

then gossips out contradictory transactions could that lead to gridlock in the consensus process if other nodes refuse to accept contradictory transactions if not why not and how does gossip about gossip prevent this oh great question no that's not how it works i'll explain how it works um but good i'm really happy people are thinking about these things and you know asking questions about how could you attack it is 90 of what you do when you're building something you spend ten percent on how do i build it and ten percent on oh what a tax could there be so i love the way you're thinking but that's not actually how it works so let me tell you how it works the way it works is that if you were to create two um transactions that shouldn't both happen they're mutually exclusive i think that's what contradictory means here for example a double spend i only have one h bar in my account and i try to make a transaction that will send one h bar to alice but i also make one that will send one hbar to bob and maybe i go spend it in their stores i'm trying to get something from alice by spending an h bar in her store i'm trying to get something from bob i sit in an h bar in his store and if i get away with it i'll have bought two things worth an h bar but only spent one h bar double spins would be great for me and disastrous to the whole universe so that's not what happens what happens is i create these two transactions one of them says give a given h bar to alice one says give an h bar to bob i submit them to the network to the same node or to different nodes it doesn't matter maybe it's an honest node maybe it's a malicious node it doesn't matter either way they all they both go out to the whole network the whole network gets consensus they talk back and forth they do gossip about gossip they do virtual voting and they end up on a consensus on an ordering of all our transactions so both of these are in the order both of these two mutually exclusive transactions are in the consensus order they've all agreed maybe they all agree that alice came before bob but whatever they agreed on they all agreed on it they all agreed that bob was first or alice was first whichever way so suppose alice came before bob then once everybody has consensus then every computer all by itself without talking to anyone walks through all those transactions and makes them have the appropriate effect on the state so when they get to alice's they say i see leemon wants to give one h bar to alice fine we'll make leemon's balance go down by one we'll make alice's balance go up by one the total number of h bars in the universe is conserved it's constant and leemon just gave a coin to alice great then everybody because we're all in the same order will eventually get to bob's everybody gets to bob's later than alice's because we all agreed and then bob's transaction they say oh libya's trying to send an hbar to bob but leemon doesn't have any hbars in his account that account has zero h bars this doesn't happen and so then they all agree to do no change at all on the stake nobody will change their local state bob does not get any more h bars and for that matter i don't lose any because you can't have negative hbars so everybody changes the state the same way and the state is good no gridlock no double spins it's all good you could say what about a malicious node what if he just gave bob the coin anyway he gave a coin to alice and coin to bob or maybe a million coins to bob what if he makes a bad state ah he can't get away with that either because about once a second every single node digitally signs the state the whole state all these balances of alice and bob and everything are in a gigantic merkle tree and every second everybody digitally signs the hash at the root of the merkle tree it guarantees that every single bit in that tree is correct so everybody is signing exactly the same hash saying among other things this is alice's balance this is bob's balance and all of the honest nodes will agree they will all be digitally signing the exact same state saying that yes alice got one more coin but bob did not if a malicious node says i don't care i'm going to give a coin to bob anyway then that one node will have a different state the hash of that state at the root of the merkle tree will be different he can digitally sign it and he can send it out to everybody else and everybody else will look at it and say that signature's not good that is not a valid signature on the state i know about i'm going to ignore it and so all the honest nodes completely ignore that signature and so if more than two-thirds of the nodes are honest and a mirror node collects signatures from more than two-thirds of the nodes then the mirror node knows for sure this is true and so malicious node cannot lie about the state so there's no gridlock there's no breaking consensus and there's no double spins and you can know for sure that you're getting the right answer that is how it actually works all right very cool leemon thank you wow we are while you are on a roll um leemon what happens in the unlikely event that an", "title": "If transactions

how do we know the platform is truly decentralized if anyone responsible within treasury could suddenly reallocate stake to whatever nodes they see fit what stops them from doing this what are the security measures in place so this cannot happen and what is the process for allocation to a council node and then re-allocation to another node or a new council member i love it i love this you guys are thinking about attacks this is fantastic okay first of all terminology we do not have an organization named treasury there are no human beings that say i work for treasury it's not like the united states having a treasury department when we say treasury we're just talking about the accounts not people accounts the treasury is the accounts that hold the h bars that sort of belong to hedera itself as a as an organization so when we say treasury that's what we're talking about then the question is okay who can change that is there's some random guy that's allowed to take all the money out of treasury and do anything he wants with it no that would be really bad to take things out of treasury it's like any other account it has keys on it it has to be signed by a certain fraction of those keys and so uh the idea is that all of the really critical things moving things out of treasury like you said or changing staking the treasury which is the same thing or um i mean would be equally affecting our security but anything we do with treasury accounts or anything we do like automatic upgrading to the software we don't have that yet but when we do it'll come from a transaction that's been digitally signed or if you want to change now there's lots of things you can change in the system that affect security and to make any of those things happen you have to digitally sign the transaction with a bunch of signatures of a fraction and the council ends up having control of all these things so we have everything automated when we allow transactions to be doing all these things software updates and moving things out of treasury and changing proxy and so on it is a threshold signature where you need a bunch of council members to all sign it and when i say a council member that also is not a human being it is a whole company and a typical company can have multiple people within it that have to have a majority of them or some fraction of them signing and so the only way you can do one of these dangerous operations is by submitting a transaction signed by a whole bunch of council members and the only way a council member signs is if it's by a bunch of employees of that council member and if all of that happens then the dangerous operation happens so from the very beginning it's been a very high priority to make sure that we are protecting things like what you just described um because it's critically important uh so i just wanted to make sure that that was clear and also when we say treasure we're not talking about a committee or department or an organization that's just what we call the accounts the treasury is the accounts holding the hvac it's not a person and so we always worry about a rogue actor and great question thanks lee man i think

question so a hash is when you take some message and you crunch it down to just a few bites and hopefully it's really hard to find two messages that crunch down to the same string of bytes we know they exist but we think it's really hard that's the purpose of a cryptographic hash is to be really hard to find a collision if you ever find a collision even one on shot two the entire world will stop using shot two algorithm they'll just abandon that algorithm if any human ever finds even a single collision in fact if any people even find math that suggests that maybe someday we'll be able to find a collision people would immediately start abandoning shaw two and move to shop three it is that big of a deal in the cryptographic community is that we want to be absolutely sure that nobody can find a collision on any of our hashes and there's old hashes md5 shaw one shaw there was a shaw before shaw won um and they were they were abandoned because they had this flaw you could find collisions um so so a collision is a really bad thing in the world you're not going to find one by accident that at least we're sure of all the computers on earth could be creating hatches as fast as they can for all eternity and the sun will burn out before they find a collision i mean we we know this okay this is easy the question is is there a secret flaw in the algorithm and that's exactly the same kind of questions is there a secret flaw in the signature algorithm that would let you forge signatures or an encryption algorithm would allow you to read encrypted messages and um you know that's the whole point of cryptography is to try to not have that happen the good news is that a lot of people have spent a lot of time looking for bugs in our current hash algorithms and um signature algorithms and encryption algorithms i mean the world as a whole has spent a long time and sha2 is well trusted and we go beyond that so when i say char 2 that's the name of an algorithm but it comes in different sizes and everybody says 256 bits is enough it's a very common size used in other ledgers it's a common size to use throughout the world and the the world's cryptographers believe that 256 bits is uh plenty um however we go beyond that and in fact there is this csn cnsa standard that the u.s government uses to protect its own top secret information and they require you to go beyond that don't use 256 bits use 384. we actually do that we use 384 uh on our hashes that we sign like i talked earlier about the merkle tree we always sign the hash the merkle tree guess what our merkle tree is 384-bit hashes this is that higher standard that you would use if you wanted to protect top secret information you'd have to use that higher standard cnsa standard we use that we use more bits that's 128 more bits that's not just 10 times stronger like it would take 10 times as much work to break it or 100 times as much work to break it or a thousand times as much work it would be one with dozens of zeros after it that much more work to break it it's much much harder also maybe coincidentally we don't have any quantum computers right now but the world believes the world cryptographers believe that if you could make a gigantic quantum computer and then go beyond that and make it really gigantic in a really big sense that there's a sense in which you could break 256 bits but you couldn't break 384 now even breaking 256 is really a long shot um you it's really hard but but maybe you could and um but if you go to 384 it's believed to be secure and so we've actually made our hash so hard to find a collision on that the world's cryptographers believe that we're using the standard for um that's post-quantum that can survive quantum computers and in fact there's speculation that that's why top secret information has to use 384 instead of 256 because they're worried about quantum computers someday corrupting old things or you know attacking old things so that's a long answer to a short question um but uh yeah if anyone finds collisions then the whole world collapses but probably isn't going to happen and we're doing everything we can and we're actually going far

some places and they'll exist more as they go on another one is you can do things with an app net maintaining knowledge about hbars and there's things you can do there there are things like interledger communication that we can talk about in the future when everybody has state proofs um i certainly hope all the other ledgers will someday get state proofs because that's really what you are needing uh so we can talk about that sort of thing uh there's even things aside from ledgers that people talk about where you wrap an h bar inside of a legal contract that you didn't have traditional shares in there's just lots of ways to slice and dice this problem how to move things around between ledgers and between people and obviously we should be doing all of them at once and

but it says today um you know we hedera as leemon has mentioned is our goal is to be the trust layer of the internet and so as such our marketing will always reflect all substance and no hype um i do think it's important to share with this community that everything that you see out there everything that we do on the marketing side is earned and not paid so we don't buy any of these endorsements we don't pay people to write about us we don't do any of those things that you know as a company we have seen others do either in this job or in previous jobs and you know sometimes that will have a short-term effect but does not have a long-term meaningful impact on the value of the company and people's understanding of what we really do and you know how much we are able to communicate the benefits and uh of being you know that trust layer of the internet and we also have a governing council that we report to that expects us to set high standards and you know achieve those high standards uh across marketing and across every other area so it's important that we we market and we communicate to the community at a level that they will all be proud of and be pleased to be

Would Leemon join the community doing so?"}, {"end_time": 3028.0, "start_time": 2740.0, "text": "that mance posed during the open access event leemon ah i think this is the balance of account zero zero one so a lot of people notice that it's a little over six it's about two pi yes you're correct it is two pi but as they say in school don't forget the units the balance was not 2 pi yeah got that okay so everybody said the balance was 2 pi that is not right the balance was 2 pi h bar so let's talk about physics physics is fun um we have fundamental constants of nature seven of them have been actually used now to define the metric system so like is a certain way that cesium can make light you could ask how many times per second does it wiggle what's the frequency of this particular type of light given off by free cesium and people used to do experiments to measure it and then they said no instead we're just going to pick a number and say that is the answer by definition so how long is a second it's however long it needs to be to make that answer be right and so they actually define the second by picking the frequency for that one situation and then the speed of light is something people used to measure but there came a time when they said nope we're no longer going to make it be a question of what's the speed of light in meters per second we're just going to pick a number and say that is the speed of light and i've already defined what a second is so how far is a meter uh the meter is however far it needs to be for light to go one light um one light second in one second and so they picked the speed of light as a number they fixed which then indirectly defined how long a meter is how about the kilogram that's the last one in just last year we finally fixed it we meaning humanity i didn't get to participate but humanity finally got to fix it it used to be before last year that a kilogram is however much this certain thing lump of metal in france happens to weigh at the moment technically it's mass and there's even evidence that mass was growing over time but it was always one kilogram and every year the definition of a kilogram changed to match whatever the mass of that lump of metal was insane so instead they said we're going to say that planck's constant which is a lowercase h is a certain number it just is and now that we've already defined the second and the meter this indirectly defines the kilogram a kilogram is whatever mass it takes to make planck's constant be that exact number and so nobody will ever again measure the frequency of that kind of light from cesium or the speed of light or planck's constant because they're now defined to be a number and we're defining our units in terms of them so that's how fundamental it is in physics now often in physics people use a different number often in the physics equation you'll see h over 2 pi that's really common you see this h reduced by 2 pi the reduced planck's constant is a really common thing in fact it turns out that angular momentum of particles is quantized it's always a multiple of this it's like two times this or three times this or one times this it's never one and a half it's quantized so it's a pretty fundamental thing in nature is this reduced constant and it gets tiring to write that in equations all the time so instead we say h bar equals that basically they're saying i'm going to write the letter h but instead of writing the divided by 2 pi i'm just going to be lazy and write a bar through it instead i'll reduce it down to just a single thing and so if h bar is equal to h over 2 pi and you do some algebra what do you get well you get h equals 2 pi h bar planck's constant is 2 pi h bar the balance of the account wasn't 2 pi the balance of count was 2 pi h bar which is planck's constant which is a fundamental thing of nature and even defines the kilogram so we finally got rid of that lump of metal in france because of the two pi h bar that's the answer all right well i unfortunately i don't think anybody in the community solved it but i love that you gave us all an explanation leemon so thank you i do want to say our community is really smart lots of people saw that it was two pie lots of people it occurred to them that there's a two pi divided and h over two pi is significant eight you know planck's constant divided by two pi significant so people did uh talk about lots of pieces of this so we did have a smart community uh just nobody ever said two pi h bar is flank's constant but um but i think people probably thought that too they just never told me um so i i am very impressed with all you people um and um it's all good all right um as we get to the top of the hour mance um and leemon what is your view on calling

fair to say that leemon prefers hederans but i prefer hedarians and so here's what i propose i propose that you the community should have a poll and we will go with that and you know brainstorming here i think maybe we will create a t-shirt and uh you know use it you use whatever you come up with on the t-shirt just a bit of trivia this was not planned um paul madsen and i used to work to get of course paul as part of the company here we used to work for another company and every year we would have a conference in that company and paul would come up with the t-shirts in on the sleeve it would say t-shirts by paul and he had these pithy uh sayings and and cool things that would go on the t-shirts this went on for a decade so i think we have a poll we come up with the term and we put paul to work and we create a new series of t-shirts by paul and make those available i love it and if you guys are not following paul on twitter you definitely should there are all kinds of um hedera puns and hashgraph puns and dlt puns that go on on his twitter feed yeah and i love the creativity of this community you guys are heroes and one of you just suggested hedera i like that and uh i saw the meme of um h4 man i thought that was hilarious it was a batman yeah anyway anyway it was very cool um so you guys are very creative we should figure out a good name for you have a poll let's

of thing brain human inter computer human interface through the brain is fantastic it's really exciting they've already been experiments that show that by putting something here you can give a blind person sight and someone has actually done this where they can walk through the subway and they have sight and you put a little bit lower in the brainstem and you can actually go to the auditory text and give hearing to someone who's never heard anything and we're just scratching the surface here the biggest problem we've had in the past is that arrays of rigid needles go into the brain and they um end up having scar tissue and they stop working after a while there have been experiments with just putting in sort of a net on the surface of the brain which doesn't cause star car tissue but it has problems with um you can't see as deeply um elon has this cool system where you have the needles but they're more like threads and maybe it won't have the scar tissue i don't know uh so i don't

you we always want to give some some good meaningful answers and and you know the third is we also try to not overlap with questions that can be found in either the hedera faq or the hedera website so we do get a number of questions and if you browse through the website in terms of talking about things like governance or things like how is very different from a blockchain and you know some of those questions this community has been with us a long time we know we have some new users and we're excited to welcome them but we also want to be mindful of the folks who have been with us a while and you know and are already aware of the answers to those and so please definitely keep the questions coming for those of you who are new welcome we have a ton of video content and lima and mance and the rest of team have put up some really educational videos on our youtube channel so i would also encourage you to go there if some of those questions are not being answered here but please do keep the

working on our plugins that we have for hyper ledger and for our 3/4 and for quorum so that you can use these private ledger's and just flip a switch and turn them into an app net with hedera so you get the trust of hedera but then we're also working on ways of doing the communication between networks and so between hedera and other ledger's and so this is all interesting stuff we have our

such hurdles for adoption so as to make hcs a de facto enterprise choice over private conventional ordering mechanisms right so let me just say that i am interpreting that to mean over conventional or older old-school calm old-school ordering mechanisms like raft consensus mechanisms raft and pbft and others so to answer that question we need to first really identify the most significant hurdles to adoption for dlt projects today and of course we've done that and what we found is that there are a lot of there's a lot of effort on the part of those projects to create the consortium that that they need for distributed trust the first year or two for many of these projects is spent not only in developing software but pulling together a group of participants in order to create the distributed trust this requires that the members of the consortium create business frameworks legal frameworks operational processes that govern the distributed network and that activity detracts from the more important work of creating the application and deploying the use case there is a lot of time wasted on the creating and managing of the distributed trust so that's the problem we decided to solve that's the biggest problem to realizing value in these organizations so that's what we decided to solve hcs eliminates this source of friction or hurdle to adoption if you will by literally offering distributed trust as a service and i've said it from the beginning the tech is important but the council is equally important the hedera network operated and governed by our world-class council is the product and so that's the biggest hurdle and that's what we've uniquely identified and created to solve that problem in the marketplace now there are other you know other things that we're doing that add value and make it easier to use hcs as a service and to address certain categories of use cases and all those are going to be important we'll be rolling those out in the coming weeks and months

committees yeah so i think it's interesting to take a step back and look at the differences at a macro level between our industry and other tech industries that have emerged over time so if we look at ai for example or i oh tea or cloud right you know you pick pick your sector pick your technology sector in those cases after ten years of being in the market seeing you know inception and growth in the market and multiple rounds of vc investment there are always success stories there are always acquisitions of companies for a hundred million dollars or more and not just one or two but you know a reasonable number of real success stories after more than 12 years since bitcoin has been introduced it's difficult to point to those same types of success stories in our industry there just aren't many there are protocol platforms that have really high market caps but not a lot of real usage by applications that are driving real value what we believe is that's because people are looking in the wrong places to find that value so we've been making strategic investments in use cases associated with our council members and other large enterprises that will drive true value creation and high tps on the network and we're betting that even just one meaningful enterprise deployment could drive more value creation than what's currently found in crypto today so that's that you know the history here not just of our industry but observing the cycles in the tech sector over decades and looking at the differences between what we've observed and where we are today in our category has absolutely influenced the focus area for us in terms of the way that we use treasury and and think about think about how to use the treasury to drive usage of the platform all right thanks man and leemon a

currently now this was and this was not a guarantee this was a speculation leemonn mentioned we have quite some time before getting anywhere near this threshold but we are now seeing it could be outpaced very rapidly and perhaps almost overnight what measures are in place to scale quickly if need be oh well i would love that to happen overnight i don't think that's gonna happen it'll happen slowly i do think we're going to see enormous volume of transactions and coupon bureau itself is going to have a large and other people we're talking to we'll have a lot that will come gradually over time we're not going to have 10,000 overnight it'll come gradually sure we can we can raise that throttle we need to right now we're nowhere close to it so we'll leave it at 10,000 we can raise it later the raising this speed of main net is easy we do want to make sure that all of the mirror nodes can keep up and so we now have an ecosystem of people writing mirror nodes we want to make sure that they're all they all get notice and that they you know improve their software to be able to handle high speeds before we go to high speeds but that will happen it's not it's not impossible to make your neuro node fast you just have to test it on fast things and you know architected so it can be fast and so we'll see those keeping up i don't see any any concerns that usage is going to grow faster than the mirror nodes can keep up with or that the main that can keep up with i think that they'll raise their speeds at the same time now when we get to truly high volumes you know a million transactions a second no single shard ledger could ever do that we're going to need to have shorting and that's easy to add to and so we'll add that too and the real the real constraint on sharding is that you don't do it before it makes economic sense so when you're doing 13 transactions a second mirror nodes can keep up main that nodes can keep up why go to the expense of having more shards but as the traffic justifies it well absolutely go to more shards and then you have separate mirror nodes for each shard so they keep up to everything scales great so sharding is easy to add but again we don't need it today and we will we will easily add it when we need it and i am i an excited about people at coupon girl that i think are going to have a good number of transactions and we should be clear it's not going to be ten thousand overnight that it also is going to have a ramp up there'll be a graph you know a curve that it ramps up but ultimately i think a lot of people are going to have

financial firm sold around 25 million h bars on finance during the lg announcement is this true and can we expect this to happen with future council member announcements yeah so while i understand it might have looked that way it's not the case it's not the case at all so let me just set the context for those that don't understand that the larger picture here we do incentivize the well not incentivize we comp our employees in part with tokens and when we release those tokens to the employees we withhold a portion of those that we then turn around and sell slowly over time to pay the taxes associated with that comp plan we go ahead immediately and pay the taxes there you know there rules about how timely you have to pay the irs for when we're when releasing those coins to the employees we we paid the taxes immediately out of our cash account we have coins then that we sell bears slowly into the market over a period of time and replace that cash balance from those token sales and we do sell through well we sell to a third party for those tokens while it might look like that 25 million was sold in connection with the lg announcement that's actually not case the lg coins were sold it's not the lg coins the coins that were moved to that account that was observed by the community they have nothing to do with lg were sold over a period of weeks in fact in fact the final set of those coins just got sold on monday of this week we have internal guidelines that limit how much h-bar we sell on any given day and it's a function of the daily transaction volume so so the most that we've sold since moving those coins over to that account the most that we've sold in a single day is just over a hundred thousand dollars so while you know perception here doesn't mirror

sector of course we have that we want at least one member from an ngo sec the ngo sector we don't have that yet said still to be done the requirements are that the universities have to be in the top 10 globally corporations have to be in the fortune 500 for their region so you may see some corporations on the council that have smaller overall market caps compared to perhaps others but we also want representation on a global in some regions don't have as large corporations in terms of market cap than than others and so that's how we measure that they have to be in the fortune 500 for their region and then we want at least three members from each of the different geographies north america south america and maiya and asia pac so there you go that's the membership criteria and i hope

one computer can arbitrarily influence the ordering and even maybe not allow you to get things through the network then then you might use some other systems but if you're willing to pay a small fee then you can have a bft you can have the ddos resilience and you can have the fairness you can have the speed and reliability you can inherit the trust of our network you don't have to go find your

point will council members take ownership of their equal portion of h bars and treasury to be staked on their nodes and will there be a multi sig feature to ensure that h bars that outgoing council members possess in private accounts are passed on to incoming members wow no that's not how it works um i would be very scared if that were the way it works that would be a problem so that's not how it works here's how it works the coins that are owned by hedera you know the gigantic treasury pot of coins are not given to the members they're not staked by the members their proxy staked to members that's a big difference so they are owned by hedera they are under the control of hedera they have a multi-sig account that requires most of the coderre members to agree whenever they move around one particular member running one particular node has you know a thirty ninth of all the coins proxies that's what we'll be when we have 39 members we were doing oxy sneaking 139th of all the coins will be proxy stake to them but that doesn't give them control of those coins they can't move those coins they can't take them they can't give them to someone else they can't spin them all they do is they run a node and those 39 are that 39th of all the coins that we have are lending their weight to their voting and how they are running the note in the consensus algorithm gives them weight in their consensus algorithm that's it but that 139 will be in an account that has the keys of all the council members on it and it takes some fraction more than half for more than two-thirds i forgot what it was take some fraction of all the council members to agree for coins to move in and out of that and so when one council member leaves another one comes in we just had the whole council sign off on a transaction that says well stop stop proxy is taking to that computer that isn't even running anymore now i want you to stock proxy stick to this new computer that's running in its place and that's all so no the council never know council member controls a huge fraction of our coins it's the council as a whole that is controlling the coins and that's important for truth for all the problems that were suggested by the question those problems would arise if you just gave it to a council member instead please give them back and had to rely on their goodwill to get them back we don't do that all

don't even understand gerontology it's not well understood there is telomere shortening and there's free radical damage and there's other things but we're not even sure we even understand the full list of what the things are and how they work if we actually understood it that would be a fascinating scientific abstract question on its own and might lead to technologies where you don't get old you kind of stay young for your whole life and maybe your life is even longer but you definitely be healthier in your old age i do think that we will get to the point where we can be far more healthy in our old age than you are now so those are the science questions i think they're all exciting i really would like rather talk about a technology question what's the biggest technology problem that is under looked at right now and i would say that is molecular nanotechnology can we build machines at the atomic scale that build others including copies of themselves at the atomic scale can you have a like a 3d printer that melds other 3d printers where every atom is where you want it to be or a factory that does the same if you can do so it totally changes every aspect of the world it's

that field i would say it's the problem of an in silico replicator could you build a self-replicating machine model just simulated in a computer just say where all the atoms are and then simulate it and have it work i would say that is the central the single biggest problem that ought to be worked on right now in molecular nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology would be the single most

are lots of fun that doesn't keep me up awake at night and i know that there are a number of smart people that it does worry them but i'm not worried about it i think that ai has made enormous progress in some areas and hasn't even started in others and and we can talk more about that if people ever have questions about it but there are areas where ai is vastly better than you could ever have imagined it would ever be and other areas where it really doesn't even have the first start and we don't know how to get started yet and we really don't even have and i clue about how to start so i'm not worried about an ai machine getting smart raising an army and destroying mankind this is humanity is safe from from the rise of the machines i think right now also people who are worried about super smart machines even if we could get over those barriers i often forget about the fact that we'll have augmented humans humans will have ai is helping us as well as the ai is against us so even so i'm not worried about that what i do worry about is that it takes to our question our focus away from the real problem and this is the real problem ai is going to bring about an industrial revolution that is bigger than the original industrial revolution but occurring on a much more compressed time scale which means you know all our jobs are going to go away and be replaced with new kinds of jobs no that's great 100 years from now we're all going to really happy that this revolution happened that's not the question the question is in the revolution itself lots of people will lose jobs new jobs will be created but will they be created in time and will the people who lost an old job be able to transition to a new job this is an enormous problem and so although it's fun to watch terminator movies this isn't where our real concern should be right now our real concern should be can we navigate the rapids of this transition to a world where ai is doing a lot of the things we're doing now and a lot of those things are drudgery they have the potential to make the standard of living much much higher for every human on the planet but there's also an enormous potential for great agony in the meantime and we've got to make sure that we transition wisely so yes ai is a huge threat to short-term happiness but yeah i'm not so worried about our robots in the streets hunting us down okay related to that though another interesting aspect of a i believe in do you have any thoughts on how a i can be", "title": "Does Leemon believe that AI will take over the world and how does

our current ai most of our systems require enormous amounts of data to come to conclusions so if you go out and collect all that data and there's bias in your data you only collected it from some kinds of people and other kinds of people you only collect it in some situations and not in other situations then your system will absolutely have overwhelming biases that are bad and it will make bad decisions and if you're giving it the power to make decisions that affect people then you will hurt people this is the first problem it's a problem in getting ai to work at all and then it's a problem in will ai have biases it actually hurt people so that's the first problem is getting data it's a very hard problem there's a huge amount of research in using doing more with less data which we've got to keep doing more of basically you use a lot of data to generalize and learn general things and then little tiny data sets can make you really smart on little tiny areas because you're kind of leveraging all that other data stuff like that there is a second question as well what have you that perfect data and you see a correlation that truly is there to what degree do you want to harm people based on a correlation maybe some aspects of me correlate with her terrible people does that justify treating me like i'm a terrible person hidden minority reports said this well what if there's evidence you're someday gonna commit a crime but you hadn't committed it yet should you be punished for what you haven't done what if i correlate was so i know someone who's first and last name happened to be the same as a known terrorist he says every time he goes to an airport he gets stopped and he has to go through extra checks and things it's a true correlation he really is correlated with that terrorist in his name but does that justify making his life worse every single time he goes through an airport through his whole life and that's a bigger question than us day i but anti amplifies it ai is a tool amplify it's what we can do so it amplifies the problems that we are struggling with so it's a long answer to an even bigger question i think all right thanks leemon

number of calories not super calorie constriction which is sort of a reasonable number of calories i try to walk at least 10,000 steps a day some days it's 20,000 and almost all of that is in my

the team but outside of those two things life hasn't changed much the one thing that i am looking forward to in addition to being back with the team is to take my kids to a theme park it's been it's been a long time they have been locked up with me and my wife here of course and we're looking forward to getting out and just having some fun so maybe a trip to disneyworld or something like that all right fingers crossed and how about you liam i like to go to movies i like to go to restaurants i am going to restaurants um but you know we've opened up restaurants here in texas but also our

out and hike through some trees sometimes and yeah i'm working from home he works out okay so i hope everybody's staying safe i hope everybody's staying sane and finding ways to to be happy and finding ways to to live life so make sure that you know we're constraining what we can do but that you find a way to live life and enjoy life and i would encourage everyone to do that don't just wait for the name and we're free but find a way to be free inside in your mind even when we have these constraints that's what i would would hope everyone can do thank you leemon and for while we are

heard from the community is that we'd love to hear more from your councilmembers we'd love to hear what they're doing we'd love to hear how they're engaged and and you know we just like to see their smiling faces so we need today to have kamal yousefi with us from swisscom swisscom was one of the first council members to join us and with our initial set of announcements and so hello kamal welcome

i finally could find missing in ecosystems which is providing the centralized public network for the globe with enterprise-grade governance model so it was something unique back at that point of time i appreciated so i engaged so for us as an organization of which is great and as you look ahead what about there is most exciting to you so to be honest there are two things that i really appreciated until i really like about him in america the first one is the decentralized governance model covering there is no fork so there is a guarantee for that and equal voting for major decisions pertaining to the protocol code base and its development so we feel that we actively contribute in the development of the platform we feel that we are involved we see that our feedback and comments and also the our experiences are reflected in the protocol and therefore we do our best to have yeah each other so to come up with with [music] [music] enterprises so if you come up with centralized great and come

requirement to be used to deploy a data protocol connectivity and hosting requirements steers the direction of software development and as i mentioned this also happens within the governance and all the council members can equally vote on great kemal thank you we so appreciate you coming on and joining us today you are of course you know welcome to stay on but and we thank you for your time and for being willing to answer some of those questions on it has been great working with kemal i just really have appreciated him on the council it's been wonderful we have some fantastic council members all right for those who are just joining us now hello and if you have not been to ahead here at town hall before we have solicited questions from the community and some very very serious and important and others things that you're just curious about and hey we're in quarantine so we all have time so we're gonna start with some related to hedera and then we're going to jump in at the end for some more personal thoughts from manson and as i said you know we solicited questions from the community leeman one that we heard a lot from we touched on it a little bit last time but i think not to the extent that people would like to hear is how is hedera's proxy staking different from other", "title": "Which Committees is Kamal on and can he share some details about their work?"}, {"end_time": 954.0, "start_time": 530.0, "text": "networks and also when will it be available oh yeah so we are a proof of stake system we are starting with a council running the nodes and then eventually we'll move to other people including the anonymous notes so this is the path to decentralization as a whole webinar on that the whole idea here is that we need to be secured every step along the way so initially when it's the council it's pretty easy to make it secure and it's it's proof of stake and it's just you know we're staking there the important thing though is that by the time you get to anonymous nodes if you want security against sibyl attacks where one person pretends to be a bunch of people you need to do proof of stake now you could say we'll we want everyone who's holding coins to be running a node but that won't happen some people don't want to run nodes so the only way you could really have security there is if you then have proxy staking so that most of the coins are being proxy stick to the nodes that are running that means that those nodes get credit for those coins so the way the consensus algorithm works is that the nodes are virtually voting on things on the order of the transactions and the timestamps and everything and the nodes have a weight in the vote that is weighted by how many h bars they have and that could be the node itself staking the h bars or can be other people around the world proxy sticking to that node so if you want to be secure in the final state where we have anonymous nodes you have to have proxy staking it has to have certain properties which are different from i think the proxy is say can we see another ledger's initially you don't need it at all well we just have 39 council members running nodes you know it doesn't matter or 13 or whatever it is it doesn't matter whether we have proxy staking or not but the important thing will be in the long term we have anonymous nodes that everybody can be able to proxy state so the goal of it from the beginning is for the security in the end the smooth running of the network itself there are other reasons that people have set up something sort of like proxies taking on their ledger's for other reasons to try to motivate people to lock up coins or whatever it's none of that we're not doing that what we are doing is proxy staking as part of making the ledger work and making it be secure so what are the implications of that how does that affect what we do well one thing is we don't need people to lock up their coins for very long periods what we need you to do is to proxy stick your coins to a node that you think is reliable and it is running well and has not shown indications of being bad in the past when we get i don't know when a year from now two years from now whatever it is and we can get to where we have anonymous nodes the hope would be that we would have a lot of people doing anonymous nodes so that no one person would have too many of them and that the people proxy staking would then be a proxy staking to lots of different reliable anonymous nodes so no one anonymous node would have all the proxy staking we will have a cap on how much proxies taking can go to a single node that way it encourages people to spread it out now you could say well there'll be a civil attack a bad guy stands up lots of nodes but what we all have is you're encouraged to spread it out to reliable nodes have been alone around for a long time not just to know that stood up yesterday and so you're encouraged then to be doing nodes they've been around for a while and if a lot of people are doing nodes then it becomes hard for one person to have stood on all of the anonymous notes this is the goal if that is the goal then we don't need to force you to lock up your coins for a long time we can just basically let everybody proxy stick with their coins we can make it a very easy thing to do you can even make it where whoever manufactured your wallet could be encouraged to do the small amount of research that is needed to do useful proxy sneaking to make us secure so we're talking about a very tiny amount of effort the effort could be done on behalf of the wallet maker oh but what if the wallet maker is bad well we want to get to a point where there's a lot of wallet makers and we're already seeing that an ecosystem of wallets starting to spring up and i think eventually you'll even see embedded wallets other programs that are kind of invisible those will be well it's too so i think we'll see a large ecosystem of wallets and then basically everybody will end up proxy staking another question would be well if you're doing that which is different from proxies taking on other ledger's then what kind of return would you get for proxy speaking well it can be minimal it can be very tiny amount a tiny amount because you're only doing a tiny amount of work to decide who to proxy stick to and you're not having to do something sacrificial like lock up your points for long periods so the proxy staking is a tiny amount of payment because you're only doing a tiny amount of work and it's not even you it's probably your wallet manufacturer whoever wrote your wallet software and so even then it's even less that we need to do to motivate people to do this we're just encouraging people to do the bare minimum amount of research on what the nodes are doing how they've acted in the past and then a very minimal amount of payment for that and so it would be a very tiny percentage you'd be almost nothing another question i've heard people say is well even with this kind of proxy staking for a very different purpose from others without the bonding or anything um why don't you give a really high percentage you know why don't you give a whole 1% or a whole ten percent or a whole whatever wouldn't that be nice well not really i mean even if we're a hundred percent it wouldn't matter if if everybody proxy stakes then even if every day we paid out 100 percent of what you have your coins doubled every day it wouldn't help you in any way because everybody's coins would double every day so a whole money supply would double every day so sure you have twice as many coins but then each coin is worth half as much and so it balances out it's the same value so the the whole point of the proxy staking payments was just to encourage a small amount of work it'll be a very tiny amount staking payments are slightly different that's paying the node to be a node that has to be more because they do more work they have bandwidth they have to pay for they have processing that they have to do on a computer they had to pay for and so staking will be a higher amount uhm and presumably will be enough i mean in the long run has to be enough to motivate you to run a node no more than that you know it have to be $10,000 a day but it has to be enough to motivate you to run a node so someday when we have anonymous nodes we will staking which will pay enough to encourage you to run an ode and we'll have proxy staking which pays a microscopic amount because that's how much you're contributing and how much work you're having to do and that's how we end up none of that is needed until we have anonymous nodes right now what we have is just very simple staking model and that's good enough for the nodes we have that are just council members but when we get to it when we get to having actual anonymous nodes then this will be very important so that's what we're doing i hope that was clear all right thanks leemon

so you know last time we were here in the last town hall i had mentioned that we were exploring a handful of categories of use cases i think to answer this question it's useful to sort of roll up those into two main categories or top-level categories of use cases that we really find interesting that we're exploring so conceptually let's let's think about two high-level categories of use cases on it and cinq-cinq here refers to the need to order transactions in distributed applications and we're addressing that top-level category of sync by integrating with the obvious platforms hyper ledger for decorum others and of course people can build their own daps for distributed applications and in-app net using hcs without using those other platforms like you just do it directly but you know where we're addressing those that the top-level category primarily by integrating with these these platforms that i just described audit refers to any use case that might benefit from some form of proof of action there are great many use cases that already operate with some level of market trust today they're in the market today meaning that the market is already affording those use cases those companies some degree of trust but they can benefit from an added degree of trustworthiness that they can get from hts ads dax is a fantastic example of this right in their use case they simply integrated directly with hcs to provide an additional level of trust in the click-through rates for their customers however our vision here is to integrate with other categories of enterprise platforms like enterprise resource planning customer relationship management enterprise asset management product life size lifecycle management you know in the enterprise world there are a full range of these types of platforms that provide an opportunity to take advantage of hcs and end up with what we internally deserve referred to as a trust plus model there are audit and proof of action use cases throughout the enterprise that would benefit from this and so we see a future where if those transactions weren't recorded through hcs then they didn't happen right that's what hts provides proof that they happened so that's that's how we view the the market all right thanks man all right and well we are on the topic of trusts and proof and liman another question from the community here", "title": "How does HCS integrate with R3 Corda, Hyperledger and Quorum?"}, {"end_time": 1412.0, "start_time": 1157.0, "text": "all transactions and balances are for the public to see are you concerned about the privacy of h-bar users ah so privacy of course on a public network the network itself is public anything you do any information you store in the network and messages or transactions you send through the network are public the whole world knows about it and that's what a public network is sometimes that's good enough and you're perfectly happy with that in which case great it's wonderful public ledger's what you need sometimes you want privacy okay so what kind of privacy do you want maybe what you want is to store information that's private then what you can do is when you store a file in head area you encrypt it before you store it that works great but then there's limits to that you can't prove to somebody else what's in that file without giving them the key to read it ok so then you could do a layer of zero knowledge proof type stuff where what you store is encrypted in a very weird way that allows you to tell other people things in it and they can see it and you can do that on top of kadare it's a layer on top of hedera you can do that or maybe what you want to do is actual do calculations with the data that you want to keep secret here things get more interesting there is actually a format that does that fully homomorphic encryption but that's nowhere close to where you could do that on ledger's so if you wanted to have true privacy in the data that's actually being calculated on by the ledger itself a public ledger won't do what you want you'd have to have something else currently people say well use a private ledger yeah but then you don't have the trust that you have from a public ledger so the whole question is i'm gonna get the trust of a public ledger with the privacy of a private ledger there is a way to do it that's hts that's the hedera consensus service the hedera consensus service sins transactions from your private application network it's all private and encrypted and only people you like can join it and everything is is secret you can send the transactions to hedera you can encrypt the transactions themselves so they're flowing through coderre but it's encrypted nobody knows what it means hedera doesn't know what it means hey there it just puts them in order and puts timestamps on them and hit era gives you trust in that order and in those triumphs time stamps and then they go back to all the people in the apt net and then the people in the apnic have the key to decode it to decrypt it to interpret it to do business logic on it or game logic or whatever it is to do the calculations with it it would be like a smart contract that has actual secrets inside of itself which you can never do in a public network for general secrets you would have to use an app net and so this app net is a way of getting privacy now if you don't care about privacy then just use a purely public ledger hey there is great if you do care about privacy use hedera's consensus service hcs and then you can have the privacy that you want and so i think it is important for people to think about privacy in everything they're doing oh there's one other thing if you're doing some kind of a proof of events or proof of action you're trying to show that you did something and have it in a mutable record then what you can record in hedera doesn't have to be an encrypted version of it it can be a hash of it and so that also is helpful not just because it keeps it secret but also because you could have gigantic pieces of information that shrink down to a little tiny hash and you're only paying to store a little tiny hash on hedera or to feed a little tiny hash through panera and we have lots of people there doing this right now this is a very big use case for hts and again you have great privacy if you want to just store them send the hash to it but if you want to publicly say something to the world and know that everybody else knows what you said and they all are seeing the same thing then being public is a good thing and so you have transparency and so you always have this choice you do transparency or new privacy both are important and you can do both if you want to all right thanks leemon ok man's

nodes there are so maybe if you can help us clear up some of the confusion on behalf of mr. goon sarire and the reporter and the rest of us yeah so we're prove a stake um maybe there isn't clear from the very beginning the very first hash craft paper that was published said you have this virtual voting going on and you could give every node an equal vote or you could weight it by their stake and so from the beginning we've said you could do proof of stake and you know hedera running right now is group\u00eds take each note is weighted by a number and at the moment we have the 13 nodes with equal numbers but you know in the in the long term those numbers will fluctuate and they won't even be equal so right now it is a proof of stake system here is a proof of stake system you don't have to know how many nodes there are you have to know how much stake each of the nodes has that's all you have to know how much stake each of the participants has the participant can be anonymous but if you have a cryptocurrency you could say well your stake is how much cryptocurrency you have in which case all you have to know about the node is its ip address and its account the account that holds the h bars that would be all that you would need to know so for hash graph in general and for hedera's implementation of hash graph what you need to know for a proof of stake system is how many h bars are in each h bar account now i hear people say maybe that's vaguely hard to do but but not that i mean they say counting computers would be hard to do but you don't have to count computers you have to count know how much stake is in each account how many cryptocurrencies how much currency is in each account which is what every ledger does there's no it's not hard that you know does does hedera know at every moment how many h bars are in each account or all of course the accounts are anonymous we don't know who has each account if you create an account completely anonymously we have no idea who you are but we do know how many h bars are in that account we have two and that's the whole point of a ledger that's true of every ledger that was cool bitcoin the very first ledger you have to

probably reduce the throttles somewhat i mean raise it to a higher number so more than 10,000 we've tried out the current software error and we've seen it run almost twice as fast as the 10,000 it's currently throttled - and there's a bunch of things we can do to make it faster so then we haven't even tuned the software and we can tune it to make it faster we also could start using the gpu so we've actually written software to do signature verification on gpu using a graphics hard to check whether your signatures on your transactions are correct or not which is a huge amount of time those checking those signatures verifying those signatures we have that and it runs fast on the gpu we're very happy with that and it is not running our software right now why because we're running at 13

we've demonstrated our ability to recruit world-class council members over many quarters and we've been able to do that while concurrently supporting third party integrations and working with the range of projects on pocs and deployments and that that continues to to be the case secondly we don't depend on heroics from our team members for our success while we like every successful startup have benefited from occasionally having team members accomplishing extraordinary things our day-to-day execution depends on combining talent and competence competency with good process and in that regard we are changing anything we have been blessed to attract world-class talent to the project we have a fantastic team and they have a singular focus of driving growth and adoption which also means continued decentralization and usage also we continue to benefit from our differentiated tech and the broader community of developers so this is a marathon and we will continue executing the same activities that we have been pursuing none of that changes and that's not restricted to council recruitment but extends to product management engineering marketing legal council operations all

wouldn't you probably wouldn't want to have a lot of nodes there would slow us down too much a moon base though with the three second round trip you could actually do that and you could have a number of nodes on the moon if you want on each new moon base and also have a number here and it wouldn't really hurt you too much i think you could end up with reasonable consensus algorithms are x times also somebody suggested we put a note in orbit i think that'd be cool there is radiation concerns even within even low-earth orbit within the protection or the van allen belt i think you still have

and it goes well with our h bar logo we wanted a word that would be easy to spell i think hedera is pretty easy to spell h e de ra and we wanted a word that would be easy to pronounce when you see it written so either way if you hear it you can write it if you see it written you can you can pronounce it we wanted it to be a word that didn't have too many syllables that was easy to say and so we thought for a whole long time before someone came up with hedera and i loved it i thought she had a great idea hedera is the wonderful name so now we're gonna fantastic okay we're gonna we're gonna try to speed around these next few so we can wrap up by the top the our leemon in your opinion what are the top three scientific achievements or", "title": "Where does the name \"Hedera\" come from

the greatest of all time but i would say in physics i would have to say in newtonian mechanics newton didn't just invent newtonian mechanics he some since invented modern science and the way we do science and so f equals ma is cool inverse-square gravity is cool but it was more than that it was saying we could explain the universe by solving differential equations and having simple rules like inverse-square we could explain everything from a rock dropping on earth to the planets going around the sun and the moon's going around the planets all with one simple equation that fundamental idea i think change science or as a reflection of a change that was happening that's always a debate but i would say newtonian mechanics was probably the biggest invention in physics more so than relativity or quantum mechanics because those were cool but they didn't change the nature of science in biology i have to say dna understanding dna there's a lot we don't understand but i think it's just going to in the future just change everything we haven't got there yet but i think it's just gonna change everything understanding how dna worked was huge starts with mendel with water genetics and then goes now into how can we sequence fast but the understanding of dna was huge and then let me say math you could argue whether it's a science or not in math i would say that the one single thing that was the biggest achievement sounds like several unrelated ones the proof of the halting problem the proof of the incompleteness theorem god\u00f5s incompleteness theorem and the hilbert's insider's problem they sound like three different things but it really is all one thing it's what is the limitations of math itself what is matt in a very fundamental sense and so just like newton didn't just invent physics he invented science this wasn't just an in in addition to math it gave us a deep insight into what math is so i'd say those three great something for everyone to noodle on

some sugar balsamic vinegar and then you add to that a dollop of mascarpone cheese ladyfingers and cracked black pepper and that combination is what i would describe as palate shocking it's just a fantastic combination of flavors that you don't normally experience and so this is my go-to whenever we we're really looking for something special for for dessert nice all right community i expect some pictures of that on some channels as you all attempt either that or you know newtonian physics okay and leemon we are gonna wrap up with one we've given you four minutes to answer the question

you have to have refining robots no it's just a big batch and some power you have to have manufacturing robots well we have 3d printers and we have other kinds of 3d milling and so on and you need to have the robots that are general purpose that can put them together and do transportation stuff and that gives you a close system of robots once you have that and all those pieces are being built very rapidly even as we talk once you have that you send a small seed to mars and after a while you have hundreds of square miles covered with underground cities yes they should all be underground you can have to mine your resources you build it in the mines that you dug or in volcanic tunnels because you want radiation protection but you'd have enormous cities underground you can put farms underground you put everything there there's tons of water on mars once you have that humans move in and it's easy you're moving into a garden of eden that's been prepared for you i think that's the right answer if you don't have the self-replicating more robots you'll never have a self-supporting colony on mars and if you just go live in a tin can and have to rely on supplies from earth that's somewhat scary i think the right way is to do this and i said mars the same thing applies to the moon everything is good on the moon too it's closer you even except you have a little bit short on water but initially we use the water at the poles so the same thing is true on the moon put up enough robots to be self-replicating controlled from earth and mostly self-controlled and then when you have a beautiful base built humans can move in to be a great retirement spot maybe i'll get to retire to one of those two places i would love to and we'll have to make sure that the robots also take up a copy of the you

Topics range from the governing council, proof of stake, Sybil attacks, HBAR, proxy staking, Hedera Consensus Service (HCS), Hyperledger, AdsDax, public vs private vs intergalactic networks, virtual voting, and open source software.\n\nWe also include some fun questions. Where did the name \u2018Hedera\u2019 come from? What does Leemon say are the top three scientific achievements or discoveries of all time? What does Mance describe as \u201cpalate shocking\u201d?

and man we would like to just thank you all for joining us and we know these are unusual times we are thinking about our community we appreciate you taking the time to spend with us and we also just wanted to reach out so it's you know it's an opportunity we appreciate everybody who sent in questions and we're gonna try to get through as many of these as we can today and a speed round if you will and we will continue to do this so we have seen some great response from the community some great interest and we're gonna try to make this a regular thing both in quarantine and potentially beyond so

mirror nodes state proofs open source open review can you just give us the latest update oh sure so you know we're continuing to do things we rolled out hds recently we know a bunch of stuff that we've done recently we've got a number of things we're working on right now that we're adding so the mirror notes i love that we have third parties running mirror notes and we're running one two and we have a bunch of different ways we want to improve those we will be coming out right now it's the mirror node alpha but we'll have a node beta and then it will continue beyond that and it shouldn't make it easier for people to run it it should make it faster it should make it better in various ways so one of the things they want to do is improve the mirror nodes get to the mirror node beta and want to make the network itself more reconfigurable with less human interaction when nodes connecting and reconnect didn't so on and so we'll be working on doing that and tuning it in various ways we will have more wallet integrations so we already have some wallets hardware wallets software wallet we have wallets that work with h bars that are third party wallets and we will continue to integrate more into those i love the way the ecosystem is building up and i want to just continue to see that and so we'll continue integrating with more wallets hardware while its software wallets and so on custody services which i guess are human wallets i don't know what you call those all that stuff we want to integrate with all of those state proofs so when you call it an esque hedera what is my balance if you don't trust that node you could ask several nodes but really what you want to do is get a snake-proof so we're working on that you'll be able to get a stake proof you know cryptographically prove to you that the node isn't right line and same thing with mirror notes you'll be able to cryptographically know that mirror nodes not lying i love that so we're working on state proofs and i think we had a webinar where i went through in detail what state proofs are the road to decentralization had it so we're working on that and then fun one is open source open review the consensus layer of the hash graph and the gossip is going to be released the source code will be released where you can read it'll be open review you can download it anonymous people can download and read it and recompile it and see what what it is and how it works and what it's doing and that'll be good and then other components we are open sourcing and so same thing anybody can download it anonymously and read it and we compile it and so on and also just be part of an open source community and build on top of it in various ways and so we're looking forward to that those are some of the things that we have that we're working on and we'll be rolling those out as they're ready great thank you leemon we have a related question before that i just want to note that this is being recorded

what are hedera's plans for weathering a global depression should one come and i don't think quite related but same questioner asked can you really get to thousands of tps to drive revenue ok - sort of related questions actually so first off hedera is not about to run out of cash we have plenty of cash on hand to carry us into next year and as we previously reported we decided to go ahead and raise an additional ten million dollars while allowing for the possibility of extending that to 15 million that amount carries us into q4 of next year while we aren't in the business of selling h-bar and we do so in a limited but compliant way regulatory compliant way we've always", "title": "What's the criteria for mainnet exiting beta status?"}, {"end_time": 760.0, "start_time": 343.0, "text": "been very concerned about being as compliant as is possible what we found is that there is strong demand for the h-bar we're in the process now of closing that first 10 million and a significant portion of the additional 5 has already been allocated and i'm expecting to close the the additional 5 so that's just to comment very briefly on our cash position second there really two primary metrics that we use when measuring the success of the project decentralization and usage and from the beginning we have focused on a decentralized governance model for making decisions that impact the network from for governing the network the council is now fully functional the interim board was dissolved in at the end of last year at the end of december and the first fully elected board took control in january the council manages treasury the they determine the product roadmap and they provide oversight of every part of the organization the council is operational the council is distributed and it's distributed across geographies it's distributed across industries so there is no single point of failure today in the network from a governance perspective from an operational perspective and importantly the hedera staff continues to relinquish more and more control of operations to the council and that process will continue so decentralization is going very well what about usage many of you have heard me say before the performance improvements in hash graph are like the difference between a calculator and a computer the applications that one builds for a computer are going to be very different than those applications that get built for a calculator and much of the dlt industry is now seen in hedera a computer for the very first time so the strategy is pretty simple we've identified four broad categories of uses of the hedera consensus service specifically but the platform more generally these aren't for use cases but rather for focus areas that will have interest from different types of stakeholders some will appeal to architects for example we just announced this week that we have the plugin the hyper lender fabric that is now in the labs hyper ledger and is out there for people to download and use and contribute to we can think of hcs in this context as layer 0 the consensus layer for distributed ledger implementations and we're building the set of tools and micro services that will appeal to developers making it easier for them to build solutions that business users will care about for each of these focus areas we're developing demos documentation and also working with customers to build initial reference implementations so in other words in this year 2020 we're demonstrating how a computer is different than a calculator and in 2021 our channel partners will use these reference accounts and reference implementations to scale the usage of the platform so yes we are moving towards significant usage now oh that sounds very abstract and i realize this is turning into a long answer up i'll try to be brief all of that sounding very abstract but let me try to make it concrete with an example yesterday and today you're seeing press that's talking about the coupon bureau that coupon bureau is a nonprofit service organization for the coupon industry the advisory committee for the coupon bureau includes target and general mills and gs1 it's an important standards body for the industry and they're working with leading consumer packaged goods manufacturers that provide and accelerators that provide access to point-of-sale systems at leading retailers that represent nearly 70% of the us retail market there are about 250 billion coupons registered every year in the united states and the systems that they use are ancient they're antiquated they're very inefficient in their rife with fraud the coupon bureau is working with us using hcs to modernize that and they are making it possible using hts for those manufacturers to register their coupons with the coupon bureau they transactions the coupons being used at the point-of-sale systems will flow through hts through ad era and then back to the coupon bureau in their database of coupons gets updated appropriately the manufacturers will run mirror notes so they have transparency into what it is that they are the coupons that are being used it it reduces fraud it provides an opportunity for analytics that didn't previously exist it makes the settlement process extremely efficient compared to the weeks or months that it takes today and it's going to result in a lot of tps it's a use case that you could not implement on ethereum right not not in the same way that we're talking about implementing it on hds it's these types of use cases that are really high throughput that require tiny cost i mean you couldn't have a cost of a quarter for a register or log of coupon that gives you a 50 cent discount right this economics don't work so to finish up decentralization we've made great strides in usage we are well on our way we expect to see tps scale and so yes i absolutely expect to see high tps and the coupon bureau is just one example of a slew of examples that we have in the pipeline that it will be announcing more and more of as we get through this year okay that was long-winded but hopefully that was helpful i love that story that they're they're working on leaving the next one is for you what is your impression of the ecosystem building", "title": "What are Hedera's plans for managing a global depression and can Hedera actually achieve thousands of TPS to drive revenue?"}, {"end_time": 1080.0, "start_time": 760.0, "text": "around today oh i love this so we're not doing everything we had this whole ecosystem of people around us third parties people we don't even know that are building things as part of building up the ecosystems are building the infrastructure that uses federa so i mentioned wallets i love that we have both hardware wallets and software well it's out there because those are both very important you have to have those and i would encourage if you have large amounts think about using a hardware wallet that's a really good thing to use and if it's small amounts you need to use it frequently then use a software wallet well we have those we have a software wallet that we wrote ourself but the plan from the beginning has been to use the ecosystem and let other people do and we're as much as we can trying to emphasize these other third party wallets now that are integrated with this so that we don't have to do the wallet we'd rather have have the community donate and so we're really excited about that we also have exchanges now dozens of exchanges and otc desks so that people can buy h bars or trade h bars or convert them back and forth with other things some exchanges will create an account for you some exchanges will let you use a credit card some exchanges only do pairs but if you already have something else you can trade it for each bars and vice versa and i love that we have dozens of them now and it's on our website if you go to hedera comm / h bars it lists all a whole bunch of exchanges we don't know if any of these are good or bad i mean we're not endorsing them and i'm not even sure it's a complete list but whenever we heard about an exchange we put it on the list and we get a link to their website and you can go see if they're good or bad but i love that i mean if there were only three we actually would have investigated them but there's 27 of them now and it keeps growing and so i love that were that we're exchange growing that way there are custody services now third-party custody maybe you have a lot of money in h bars and you don't really want to trust taking care of the key yourself you'd rather have someone else who is trustworthy protect the key and make sure you don't lose it and make sure it isn't stolen so now there's custody services and h bars have been integrated into custody services that's just an important part of the ecosystem and so i love that that is there now i think there are a lot of use cases where somebody we're going to use that there are other cases where you wouldn't want to you know you could use a hardware wallet and you could have a case keeping it in bank safe and have it multi key because we have multi key accounts and savings stored them in different bank safes you can use these cool things that let you store your key phrase or your a mnemonic phrase in pieces of metal or stamp it into metal and bury it in your backyard there's all sorts of fun things you can do but we're happy that there's this ecosystem out there that last one is of course isn't for us anybody who uses tip 39 words can use those metal things but we can too and it's really cool to use those they weren't made for us but the they're great because we're complaint or a bit 39 so it's the same list of words you could use those there's the sdks so we have a java sdk to allow developers to make calls to the api which i think is important and we will continue adding to that we're not going to abandon that you know we'd like to to no longer have to maintain our own wallets but we will continue to add code to the sdk but there's also third-party sdks now in other languages and with other philosophies for how it's designed and i love that the community is building sdks in addition to our sdk and that's fantastic and then of course the broader ecosystem is we now have plugins that will allow you to use one of these systems that would have allowed you to build a private network and then with the flip of a switch with a plug-in you turn the private network into an app net and that is incredibly exciting to me it's a game-changer because now if you have hyper manager you just flip a switch plug-in a plug-in and now it's an app net and you have the trust of dera behind your sort of private hyper ledger gives you the the privacy of a private network but it gives you the trust of a public network very cool and so we have plugins now for ethernet okay for a theorem and for corta corta are 3/4 so i think this is really exciting because we want an ecosystem that doesn't have to reinvent the wheel and there are so many wheels already built for those two things for hyper ledger fabric and for kurta and so for hyper ledger and for kurta there's these huge things out there and we've already now built plug-ins for them and you can use them to build built these things in and monitoring tools and management tools all that and so we're now combining with other ecosystems and so those ecosystems apply to us just like the metal things for keeping your keyphrase well now we have all the tools for hyper ledger and all the tools recorder you can use but that's just started and we're continuing to see this grow and i just want to thank everyone who's involved in the ecosystem and enjoy working with you awesome leemon thank you okay mance i'm going to love the next one over to you how happy are you with the current", "title": "What is Leemon's impression of the

you feel more progress needs to be made and with a number of things listed on here but including business goals business goals okay so here's how i think about the company and its lifecycle it's in sort of phases by year in 2017 we of course began to envision what a public ledger would look like built on top of hash graph we pulled together the initial team and we started writing everything down software had already been being built software started getting built way back in 2015 and 16 into and so you know 2017 was all about vision and in just the beginnings of execution 2018 we introduced adara to the world for the first time we raised money and we launched the main net and so those were big milestones for the company in 2019 we operationalized the council we had the first council meeting in february of 2019 the council has grown significantly since that time and we launched the main that for use in september of 2019 2020 is about validation it's the year of validation for the technology it's the year validation for the the uses that we envision and the go-to-market strategy the business model effectively it's the year validation for us in that context we're very excited the work that we've done so far and what we intend to do this year 2021 is the year scale so the work that we're doing now as i said before is laying the groundwork for real uses real use cases that can be used as reference use cases for scaling the company through our channel partners that starts in 2021 so am i happy with where we are i'm ecstatic with where we are are there areas where we could do better and and maybe we're there where is there friction maybe i'll characterize it that way when we when we first started we didn't know for sure that we could get the caliber of councilmember that we wanted we set the bar very high in terms of council membership look there is a very big difference between facebook going and soliciting a bunch of partners to create the council that is in libra the equivalent and a couple of guys with some cool tech and an audacious vision trying to do the same thing but we've done it and so on the one hand you know i'm amazed and and we're very happy with where we are on the other hand it's taken longer to pull that off than we expected it to take we always knew that getting the first five would be the hardest getting the next five would be a little easier and after that it would it would be easier still in one sense that's true in another sense it just takes time to work through the process that we have to go through with each council member this is not a marketing agreement that we're signing with these council members we go through m&a we go through significant due diligence and often it's the case that a ceo or a board is signing off on this council members participation in in the council so when we make an announced it's very real and a in a in a in a way that perhaps is different than maybe some others and so the process is taking longer but when the announcements are made the quality is very high so we're sacrificing time for quality and i think it's a good trade-off and so yes you know this is the one area where i'd like to see things move faster is in filling out fleshing out the council we've got a great pipeline and council members still to be announced but i would love to see you know that we're at thirty nine by the end of the year my guess is it's going to take into 2021 - to finish that part of the of the rollout all right thanks man um leemon next one for you can you improve communication

radically so here's what we have the problems it was too successful hate it when that happens so the plan was we had this name net it's important the world cares about it but we don't want to just spring changes on people we want developers to see women there's going to be a change coming to maine net so what we would do is we'd stand up a testament and we would frequently reset the test net and start over at the genesis and erase the state and we would frequently change the code on it and the idea would be that the test net would update and then you'd have a while before the main' had updated so that you could prepare for it and be know that it's coming the whole point of the test that was to give you good communication about main net hey that worked but it worked really well in fact it worked too well people started using test net really seriously i didn't really think that would happen but it did and people now are using it so seriously it's actually disruptive to them when we suddenly change the code in test net or reset it back to the initial state or whatever because they're actually using it in their development process in it in a way that was even bigger than we had anticipated so what we are going to do is stand up a preview net and so now the preview net will reflect will reset frequently and without warning and we'll have new code to give you a warning about what's about to come to the test net and then the test net when it finally changes is itself acting as a warning of what's about to come through the main net so at an extra stage to the pipeline and so now it's going to be the preview net that changes without warning and is you know it itself is the warning for the next net in the net in the stage you're in the pipeline but the test net now will be treated like something that matters to people in its own right and the state will reset less frequently and will try to get people warning before the state resets and the code will change less frequently will try to get people warning before the code changes and the preview net will now be the test net for the test net and so so i apologize that we did not have good communication for what test net ended up being and i think now with the preview net it will be what what needs to come before the test though so that's the change that we're making big change thanks leemon we had a few

communities being able to work together right well i have a couple of thoughts first off what we're building is infrastructure in the infrastructure is the same infrastructure that gets used by both camps so to speak i mean maybe we think of the two camps as enterprise and entrepreneurs that maybe is an interesting way of drawing the line aws for example aws s3 and ec2 the services of aws are used by both they're used by enterprises and they're used by entrepreneurs and so in that sense the work that we're doing is the same work for both camps or you know both personas that we're talking about here second most of the entrepreneurs that i talk to are big dreamers they have huge visions and so what we're building and proving and hardening with the enterprises is a platform that supports big ideas and big visions and so if we can climb that mountain then what we've built is something that benefits both enterprises in entrepreneurs alike so all the work that we're doing supports both visions the needs of hard core mission-critical high-volume use cases that are sometimes unique to enterprises but it's the same infrastructure that will provide the same level of performance for the entrepreneurs that are wanting to build that same level of vision the two can work together in in using the same sets of tools and and from you know working in the the same forums together and you know where the discussions are being had about how to use the technology and you know the developers groups and all of those equivalents where the hard-fought lessons are are recorded for the larger developer community to take advantage of but it's the same tech that provides the same benefit for for both groups thanks man leemon how do you expect usage to change or grow in the future", "title":

throughout this year and growing making it really production next year for a lot of companies we expect that it will be growing what's interesting is that this growth really has ended up showing us an interest in hcs in the consensus service and you know so like the coupon you're always going to be using the consensus service we're seeing the lots of people want to use the consensus service and if you look at our current throughput which is great we're getting lots of transactions per second i like that i'm going to get a lot more in the near future i think but the ones that we're getting if you look at how they break down say well you know it's mostly cryptocurrency transfers but if you look at how they're actually being used you discover and we discovered that this that they were people using it as if it were a consensus service even before we had the consensus service it was market validation that people wanted the consensus service if they were actually using our cryptocurrency to act like a consensus service they were sending microscopic amounts of h bars for no reason other than to have that memo field forever recorded in other words they were using it like a message like a topic and messages flowing through it like an hts like a consensus service with only one topic and you had to pay a one tiny bar every time you used it just to get a cryptic currency transfer to go through but it was the neville field that you cared about of course it was limited only a hundred bytes you had only one topic it wasn't a very good consensus service and even then people were building companies on it and so now that we've actually deployed the consensus service lots of people are saying great we would rather now just use the real consensus service so i think what you'll see over time is that cryptocurrency will go down and create hts will go up and since the service will go up and then in the long term i suppose both of them will go up but hts will go up more would be my guess because we are just seeing this overwhelming demand for this consensus service it's a different kind of thing and it allows you to build app nets with this property combination of properties it's unusual and so people are very interested in that and then it it drives great throughput great transactions per second and so i'm just looking forward to seeing how it ends up growing

question so insider' recently is why are using time at all couldn't you get consensus with hash stroke without even having clocks on your computers and the answer is yes so if all of our computers in the whole network broke at the same moment and all their clocks broke and they all said that current time is zero and they just said that forever it would still work we would still get consensus we would still put all of our transactions in a consensus order everybody would agree on the consensus order we would get consensus just as fast the latency wouldn't be any worse we would still be a bft it'd be hard for someone to stop us from coming to consensus hard for someone to make us come in different consensuses all those good properties would continue we would have the things that people look for in a blockchain you know the things that people expect from a list you would have those things but we wouldn't be as good if we didn't have those clocks if the clocks were all saying the time is zero then the first transaction would have a time consensus timestamp of zero and then the next one would be one nanosecond later i mean we do have it in the code we say well we'll always have the timestamps moving forward on each transaction but if all the clocks are broken and just given as zeros then each transaction would just be exactly one nanosecond later than the previous one and so you start with the time as zero which doesn't mean anything and then each transaction would have a time one nanosecond later which doesn't mean anything but if we have clocks then we can get a consensus timestamp and so if you have some legal contract that says you have to release certain information by noon on tuesday you can use that timestamp to prove that was by noon on tuesday that's something you couldn't do with broken clocks it's kind of nice they have non broken clocks and you know our clocks may not be perfect maybe everybody is trying to get the time on their computer but the computers have slightly different times you know we all go out to time servers and get times from different time servers and we're slightly off and there's delays and there's some randomness involved and maybe the clock in your computer runs fast and slow and so we all have the time that's more or less right but there's some random noise added to each person in that case the consensus timestamp works better than any single clock it's the median of all the clocks so if each of them is the time plus some random noise it kind of averages out the random noise or medians out the random noise and so you can actually have a more accurate median than all the individual ones wow fingers don't work so well you know everybody's doing things from home now and backdrops are kind of weird i get my fingers isn't that weird they disappear so if you have a whole bunch of time stamps from different computers with different random errors and then you take the median that's the middle one if you were to sort it the median is more accurate than any given computer which is kind of cool it just sort of averages out their medians out there furthermore if you have some computers that are malicious and they on purpose are wrong in the wrong by a million years meetings pretty good and somebody's saying i was a million years ago or i was a million years in the future just has a little bit of influence that's the magic of a median the median is really good at excluding outliers they had some influence everybody should have a say but not very much and so the time stamp ends up being reliable as long as most of the computers are mostly right you end up with a really good trustworthy time step and so you know you could have a computer on mars and it would still work you could have a computers that are malicious and it still work you'd have one computer with a clock just breaks and always says zero and it still works that's kind of the idea and then something that i just think is fun oh but for that part um we actually had a blog post on fairness which talks a lot about time and it shows graphs of how the median works and how the time stamps work and how time is used in hedera and sure we don't have to use time but we wouldn't have time stamps it wouldn't have fairness the fairness is really important and so that's why we use time to get timestamps and to have fairness of ordering and fairness of timestamps but the other thing i think it's just kind of fun is it always bothered me that star trek always had these things called star dates that everyone in the galaxy agrees on you know general relativity says that if all the stars are moving relative to each other that we can't all agree on a universal clock it's actually one of the results of relativity so start needs don't actually work it's probably the only thing in star trek it's not realistic but that part was you know not good physics and if you wanted to have an intergalactic wide galaxy-wide civilization where everybody agrees on time stamps and on order i mean do relativity says you and i can't even agree on an order for moving relative to each other i think x happened before why do you think why happened before x and einstein says we're both rights crazy relativity of simultaneity blows your mind no one really can grasp that but what we could do is if the federation were to use hedera as a global time stamp then they could get to start dating said everybody agrees on so clearly the federation needs to use hedera for their star dates thankfully man i hope we can they can weave that into a future

there and there's a reason for it rsa if you want to be seeing this ace require us compliant has three thousand bits thirty seventy two weeks it's more than three thousand s3 kilobits whereas it's only 32 bytes 64 bytes for a signature for a gt 519 so you can have signatures that are much much tinier for what we're using right now we may eventually expose it to users and that users use gigantic signatures if they really want to not really sure if anybody cares if they would want to on the other hand internally in the network we've always used rsa and we have elliptic curve is also supported curves that are then complain with the cns a standard so we wanted to be compliant with the security standard so internally we have support for dsa and we have support for rsa and we use big keys some people would say overkill but we use big keys because it makes us compliant with these standards for security for external people when you're just creating accounts and you want to put keys on them and you're making signatures use edge of g5 19 it's clearly the standard within this community and if i were to add another another crypto system today i probably wouldn't add rsa or actia say i probably add something else but maybe something with a great signatures like bls or something else i don't know i would add something else i don't i have not seen a strong demand for people who really want to pay for gigantic signatures and pay for gigantic keys just not a lot of demand there for that um and then we can add that feature too it's not hard to end it it's already what we use internally but i don't know if you want to do 10,000 transactions a second or more you really don't want to have these gigantic signatures floating around you'd rather have tiny signatures and so people tend to like tiny signatures and maybe in a couple years we'll go to a post quantum signature but we can wait for this to finish its contest for that those sadly will be bigger and that'll be an option i don't know how many people will use that option because post quantum is going to be inherently bigger but maybe not too much bigger but so yeah if we hear a lot of people saying they

i'm expect the network itself to become faster over time it's interesting though how they interact with each other so because of the way that hedera is built transactions themselves don't overwhelm us the state size is controlled by how many accounts are there how many files are there how many hds topics are there but it's not affected by how many hts messages flow through those or how many cryptocurrency transfers shuffle h bars between those accounts and so what you find is that the state grows as we have more of these entities the accounts and the topics and the smart contracts but the state doesn't grow just as a function of having lots of tps lots of transactions per second and so what i expect is yes we will see more entities there will be more accounts than we mor hts talks but that growth will be dwarfed by the growth in the usage of those accounts and the usage of those topics i think we'll see a greater increase in throughput than we do in the state science growing which is nice because you don't have infinite memory it's nice to have the state growing more slowly than the usage of that state so that's kind of how i would expect you to be going in the future as

now have a fork where there's two different versions though two different kinds of solidity and they aren't timber operable oh we have no interest in doing that we want to tip i hate when that kind of thing happens we don't wanna splinter the solidity world and so we will always be compatible with solidity and when solidity evolves to its next version eventually we will do so - we're not in any particular hurry to do so right away and to you know always have the latest version but will over time continue to to go to more and more recent versions of it for our solidity support we may even someday go to other languages as well but it's interesting a developer is very constrained if they have to live within a smart contract language and what would be better is if you just have freedom to use any language you want and that's what athletes give you that's what our consensus service gives you and so we've put a lot of effort into the consensus service right now like plug-ins to hyper ledger fabric and plugins to kurta which allow you to you know very easily build this using whatever language you like you don't have to use any particular language and we don't have to support it you can use this whole ecosystem that already exists and so i suspect as we've already seen we'll see more and more people switching to hds the consensus service but we will keep the smart contracts we're not gonna take them away there are cases where you want a smart contract and will still have it and we will not poison the well by taking our own weird variant of salinity we will always use the standard solidity that other people are using and you know we may be a few versions behind but we'll probably keep it you know improving periodically to be catching up on the versions but it's not a

that that is so much fun and that is not the majority of my time majority of my time ends up being endless meetings on phone calls and what i do is i walk i walk on doing math math is fun and i enjoy walking while i do that but i also walk on on the phone and i will walk five or ten miles a day in little tiny circles in my living room it's terrible and i used to walk little tiny circles in my office or i'd walk through the office walk through all the hallways but now i walk in little tiny circles in my living room which is good exercise but that's my typical day but then i also had time to

focuses of course on the tech i am working with on the business side and you know all the other stuff that is important for operations and and legal and counsel and board meetings and all of that so

seen it i would encourage you to visit our youtube channel there are a number of dapps that we have spoken with this week and we'll continue to talk to you throughout the week that are sharing just how just how green the hedera network is and how they're able to use it not only to make their dapps more energy efficient but to also build applications that are really contributing to the future of our world and contributing to make it a better place there is a report out from power transition that talks about in some very tangible numbers the differences in energy consumption of hedera versus other networks i would also encourage folks to look at those and each of the videos should have links to the applications and what they're doing so welcome to this earth week edition of our town hall and we can go ahead and get started um leemon we are going to jump in and you know we we try to tackle as many things as we can on these town halls so this month there were a number of questions from the", "title": "Intro"}, {"end_time": 174, "start_time": 83, "text": "community on the transfer of tokens from the founders accounts and whether that involves selling and whether that occurs when the price of hbar is down oh good question no no selling when the price is substantially down so the selling happens according to a plan the plan is detailed it's published on our website if there's an faq i think maybe we'll have a link to it put into the chat but the plan says no selling when it's down and there's lots of details lots of constraints don't sell too much if the volume is slow all that stuff so that is in an faq frequently asked questions that's published on our website and of course you talked about transfers what you see are transfers from accounts but when you sell coins what you usually do is you transfer a bunch to an exchange or a third party and then throughout the day you can be selling from that and you can sell it for several days and then when the balance gets low a few days later then you transfer another tranche so the transfers and the sales aren't quite the same thing if sales stop for a day or two you might not see it just looking at the transfers if the sales stopped for weeks you would see it but not if it's just briefly but the the transfers of the sales are slightly different because of the way you normally sell and all of that is regulated by the plan was established last october and it's in the faq so um go ahead and look at that if you're curious about all the details all the numbers great thank you leemon and the um i will just note that uh the faq has been posted in the chat so feel free to take a look at that afterwards for those who want more in-depth details all right mance um in the spirit of transparency", "title": "Are founders selling HBAR when the price is down?"}, {"end_time": 397, "start_time": 174, "text": "and community uh we have a request that can at least one question answered during each town hall be that which is most popular as determined by a democratic vote or awaited vote and it seems like the questions which are answered are selected solely by hedera not by the community which feels a bit scripted and unauthentic could you vote close it and ahead of the town hall um you know maybe using the hbar community telegram um capture votes for questions for these town halls sorry i'm now off mute no look i i completely appreciate the the question and understand why it's being asked it is difficult and it's difficult for some unexpected reasons and let me try to explain that there are certain constraints that we just have for legal reasons or regulatory reasons so for example we can't make any kind of predictions there can be no forward-looking statements that we you know that we make in any kind of uh public context like here the the town hall also we don't talk about token price we get a lot of questions about the hbar and about token price and predictions and blah blah blah right and we don't talk about token price also there are questions that come in that are great questions but those questions are best answered with the appropriate timing the uh the questions may be related to ongoing activities or projects and um it's just the the work that is being performed isn't yet completed and therefore it's not appropriate to talk about something that's sort of half baked so we don't we take those questions and we move them forward to the next month you know keep a spreadsheet of all the questions that come in and and there are those questions it's we just say when going through these that looks like a good question to answer next month there are those categories of questions we don't talk about our competitors we get a lot of questions about competitors of various uh you know various types of questions and various flavors many questions have already been answered as zenobia talked about earlier that you know the community is growing there are a lot of new people in the community and they naturally are asking obvious questions and we've been doing this now for a year i think i'm maybe longer and so there is just a lot of questions that we've already touched on and so we don't go back and try to address them again sometimes we do but we try to make it a policy not to and then also there are questions that maybe are asked about those that we're working with and we have to protect the privacy of our partners until they are ready to announce whatever it is that that they're working on so you know just it's not as simple and straightforward as you might imagine it being and uh and we have these constraints on us so we're certainly open to something but it's you know i can't envision an approach that addresses these constraints in a meaningful way and and that's why we do what we do thank you mance um and you know that's not to say we don't try to take things head on we absolutely do and so in that spirit leemon this next one", "title": "Should town hall questions be selected democratically?"}, {"end_time": 994, "start_time": 397, "text": "is for you um there is a public critique of hedera that the hedera hashgraph system only provides fairness of ordering for consensus messages not for transactions within a message it goes on to say any batch node transactions can choose which one of those messages came first and which one came last sorry any node batching those transactions and they can use this small power they have for instance to front run orders for example in a stock exchange can you share with us is there any truth to the statement is it moot because all transactions are batched into one event that's gossiped out um how would this play out for example in fair ordering of bids and asks in a stock exchange oh great question so there's several different misconceptions here and this is it's not how it works so first of all when one of when you want to submit a transaction you give it to a node and that node will then send it on to the whole network it gets gossiped out if you give it to the node atlas then alice will send it to the network and if several people give alice transactions she will send them out to the network and they will end up in consensus order in the order that alice sent them out now if you send transactions to bob his will be sent out in some order and they will end up in consensus order in the order he sent them out it has nothing to do with whether they're all in one event or they're all broken up into individual events that has nothing to do with it it will always be in the order he sends them out so talking about bundling into messages or bundling into events is completely irrelevant it has no effect on this it's simply that if you send your transactions to alice the order in which she sends them out hers the one sent out by her will all be in the order she sends them out the same is true for bob the consensus is then well how do alice's and bob's interleave do they interleave like this or is it like this or is it like this or is it you know sort of like this there's lots of different ways that they could interleave that's what the what the community is to figuring out but if you just look at one node they'll end up in consensus order in the order in which that node sent them out so uh has nothing to do with messages or bundling or movement or events or whatever i've seen this misconception it's just that's not how it works so then the second question is well is it going to be fair is the community going to um end up putting them in in this order in a fair way well alice put them in an order in a fair way and of course there's three different kinds of fairness here and there's talk about front running which is maybe a fourth kind of fairness and then you know life's not fair that's a fifth kind of fairness so let's talk about the different fairnesses what we would like ideally is to put them in order in the order in which the network received them you know the new york stock exchange puts things in order in the order that they come to it's one single computer we want our ledger to act like that but since we're multiple computers what would you mean by the time at which it reached the network do you mean the time at which it reached the very first node that wouldn't make any sense maybe that node never forwarded it on and then a year from now that node tells you hey i had one i forgot to tell you about would you give it credit for having happened a year earlier well you can't do that you've already made decisions you can't undo them so it wouldn't make sense to say you have reached the network when you reach the first node okay how about it when it reaches the last node when it's reached the entire network would that be the fair time to say that's when it reached the network well not really because what if that node's turned off then the whole network would have to freeze if it's turned off for a year the whole network would freeze for a year before we ever knew what order things are in you can't really do that what if you're going to treat the network as virtually being like the single computer the new york stock exchange then the most rational thing the most fair thing is to say you have reached the network when you've reached the majority of the nodes when you reach just over half of the nodes or half the nodes you have now reached the network and because of the gossip protocol it's very hard for an attacker to stop once you're in the network at all and spreading the gossip you're going to spread out to everybody very fast and so it would be very hard for an attacker at that point to stop you from reaching half the network once you've reached a few of the nodes so fairness of time stamps come from that and so if you care about fairness of timestamps this is clearly what you would mean by fairness of timestamps but there's other kinds of fairness what about the fairness of the ordering well it seemed like the most fair way to put things in order is to do it by the time stamp why would we put them into an order different from the order at which we received them you know the new york stock exchange has a single computer it puts transactions asks and bids into order by the order it received them it would be unfair to do a different order then there's just is life fair it turns out people who live right next to the new yorker stock exchange can get their bids and ask in milliseconds faster than someone who lives far away people have spent like a hundred million dollars drilling a hole through a mountain just to get to the new york stock exchange a few milliseconds faster so you could say well it's unfair that i live far away so mine gets in later yeah okay that's life is unfair um that kind of unfairness isn't the new york stock exchange's fault it isn't their algorithm's fault it's just the fact that the world is distributed and in that sense of course we have the same problem if somebody shuts down your connection to the internet you just won't be able to bid that day and that's unfair life is unfair but if you haven't access to the internet at all we do have a fairness of access that in many ways is better than what you would get with a new york stock exchange and here's why everybody might live near a different node but as long as you give your message to your node it'll then spread exponentially fast through the network and so in that sense people around the world all get to live right next door to us whereas in new york stock exchange you have to live in new york to live right next door to the server so fairness of access is better furthermore you can choose which node you're submitting to so if you know a node is nice and honest and always gets theirs out quickly then you can choose that one so if alice always sends hers out when you send it to her you see it goes out right away you can always send it to alice and if bob tends to be kind of slow and sometimes doesn't send it at all you can just ignore bob and so you get to choose so you have fairness of access in that way and then in addition you have fairness of access in the sense that if you really wanted to get out fast you can set it to lots of those and then it truly will reach the majority of the network a little bit faster just a you know a second faster or a fraction of a second i don't know but it will get there faster and so that is a way that you can manually ensure that it gets out faster and you pay a little bit more if you send it to end nodes you're not paying in times as much you only pay once for the service but the the node fee uh you pay and the transaction fee or the network fee you pay a little bit more so you will pay in times as much on that part of the fee because you're making us do more work but that would ensure that it gets out so for fairness of access it's kind of the best that a ledger could ever have you have access to it and it's definitely better than a single server like the new york stock exchange where access is only good for people right next to it and then there's the question of um well that was it right fairness of time fairness of ordering fairness of access and then just you know kind of is life fair and then there was the question about front running if you want to be able to avoid front running even with the new york stock exchange if a server is if a router along the route is seeing your your message it might put in another message reacting to that if you want to stop front running in a public ledger where the whole world can see what's happening on every node and every node is untrusted individually then what you have to do is set up some kind of system with rounds this is the way that the world has to work and so what you would do is you use hcs the consensus service to create an app net for your auction or for your stock market and you would say okay every five seconds we'll start a new round so for the first five seconds everybody can put in their bid or ask but you only put in a hash of it so nobody can read it so nobody can read it and then front run you and at the end of those five seconds it's now too late for anybody else to put in any more hashes and we know when the five seconds ends because there's a timestamp a consensus timestamp that was fair on every transaction so we know when the time limit is and then in the next five seconds you can send in your actual bid or ask and it only counts if it's hash matches what you sent during the first five seconds and that stops front running and then there's various attacks on the way that in ways of stopping the attacks and there's a whole literature about that but that's the way to get fairness in a public ledger sorry not fairness the way to stop front running in a public ledger and every ledger is the same in that respect except if the ledger is really fast that helps a lot because by going to rounds you're going to be slowing yourself down so you really want a ledger like hedge like hedera that's very very fast and that gets consensus very fast also if you do this thing with the times you really want finality so finality and speed are very very important for that but other than that it's just something you're building above the ledger and it doesn't matter what ledger you're dealing with so it's a big question we have a blog that goes through fairness in a lot more detail it has pictures the pictures help a lot and has that blog been no um so maybe we could put a link into the chat that would give you the blog post on fairness so that was a long answer we've talked about it before but um but you know not everybody sees everything and i think it's an important issue because hedera is really good at fairness more so than um blockchains and other things that we could talk about and the paper talks about that too so anyway good question thank you thank you leemon and yes the um the link to the blog is now in the chat for those who want to um read more details um one more question leemon on a technical level what would happen", "title": "Is fairness preserved for batched transactions?"}, {"end_time": 1082, "start_time": 994, "text": "if some of the main net nodes decided against a software update and just continued to use the previous consensus rules oh they fall off it's just automatic there isn't even a mechanism to do it it's just inherent in the algorithm itself what we do is every round every node has to digitally sign the hash at the root of the merkle tree of the entire state so you know about once a second every single node is digitally signing here's what i think every single account in your in your system has and what every state of the smart contract is and what all your files are and what the history of your hcs is for the last few minutes every second we're doing that and then each node collects signatures from others and if someone didn't install the software upgrade they get a different state their signature doesn't match everybody else just discards their signature it just looks like a bad signature so it just gets discarded so they basically have no effect and if they tried to send their information to a mirror node the mirror node will reject it because their signature doesn't match everybody else's signatures and so it's just they instantly get kicked off the network in a sense in a fraction of a second it's wonderful so that's what happens if you don't update the software um but we're building it so that it'll be automated so you won't even have to do anything to update the software it just happens but if you intervened and prevented it from happening you would just be automatically kicked off in a second and um just just is inherent in the algorithm all right thank you leemon um", "title": "What happens if nodes choose not to upgrade?"}, {"end_time": 1149, "start_time": 1082, "text": "mance here's one for you to tackle at your current cash flow burn rate will the transaction revenue pick up fast enough to cover expenses before you need to raise more more funding through coin sales so what we are doing is tracking very nicely very closely to the original plan both in terms of cash burn as well as tps growth so we're very happy with both of those metrics having said that there are ways in which the community can benefit from our having a an additional level of cash you know more cash and the i'm not prepared to go into all the details of what that might look like except to just sort of directly address the question and say that it's very likely that we will have another round of financing to uh to address those those needs and uh stay tuned there will be more more details

talking about how do you support fractional nfts for example for crowdfunding yes so nft is you have a bottle of wine you have a different serial number on each bottle and you have an nft for each bottle but what if you wanted to actually divide the bottle into pieces and sell shares of that one bottle um yeah so if you build nfts on top of our hts then what you end up having is each bottle counts as a token type it's like its own erc20 so our equivalent of a 721 an erc721 is like a bunch of erc20s which means that each of the serial numbers can be subdivided into 100 million pieces that's kind of cool actually more than that billions or trillions or whatever quadrillions lots of pieces if you want to or you can do a traditional nft and not let it be divisible and so when you create it you have the choice you can make it be completely divisible or not divisible at all you have that power and that's if you build your nfts on top of our hts you could build your nfts on top of our hcs in which case you do anything you want if you're using our consensus service to build an app net you can do anything you want and certainly you can do fractional so either way when you build nfts on us you get the power and the speed of hedera of the native token but you have the power for fractionalization and that's a pretty powerful concept that most nfts don't support and not

would note the volumes have gone up since then yeah well so first off and many of you already know this you don't need a license to build on top of hedera you don't even have to tell us that you're doing so so um there are a lot of projects that we're unaware of that are using the network in many cases we are aware of the specific projects that are being built but it's increasingly the case that we're not that's a really good thing right it's a good thing that people are electing to use the platform without ever having talked to us or us being involved in in that decision process at all so companies and organizations are building and deploying on the platform and only after the fact do we become aware and it's it's a great feeling to to see it happen you know when when we get surprised by seeing projects that's the way it should work and and that's happening on an increasing basis we do we are aware of some projects and we have been aware uh that some of the projects were going through various stages of testing that would drive tps so it's not entirely surprising to see you know up and down volumes on on tps from our perspective but increasingly we we don't know what's going

1570, "start_time": 1344, "text": "what is meant by controlled mutability to address legal and data compliance um we we're hearing is an immutability an essential property of a dlt oh yes so we are immutable in that sense um but we also have controlled mutability so let me talk about what this all means and uh and i think i've talked about it before but let's talk about in more depth in here boy i'm getting a lot of really good technical questions i love this so every ledger lets you have an account with coins in it and you can get more coins go in and your balance goes up and then coins come out and your balance goes down so the balance is mutable it is changing over time you have smart contracts you make calls to the smart contract and the state of the smart contract is changing over time so that's mutability of the state but the history of everything that's gone in and out is immutable no one can ever change the history it is permanently recorded forever and cannot change and the history of all the calls to the smart contract and the results is immutable it is permanently recorded forever or the same way so we have the control immutability your balances can change the state of your smart contract can change but the mirror nodes retain the history forever and not only that it's all chained together with hashes and digitally signed by the whole network so it isn't just a chain of hashes that's protecting it it's actually digital signatures from everyone in the network that is protecting it and so they these um these signatures are actually collected by the mirror nodes and they won't even believe any information they receive until they get those signatures and they store the signatures and so they have the signatures they have the entire history everything that's happened you can you could download the whole thing if a mirror node's willing to sell you their entire history or give you their entire history and we have some third-party mirror nodes that have the entire history i think there's also um ah there's now i think um s3 buckets where you can also download it from but the whole history is there you can get it it is immutable and it's cryptographically guaranteed and you can check it what's mutable is the state of the network and so every ledger has to have a immutable state we have a mutable state and the state is controlled in really nice ways and so we have all sorts of cool features like when you create a file you can have a list of signatures where all of them have to sign to create the file but only one of them has to sign to delete the file you don't have to do it that way but you can which is great you can use that for something like my driver's license i and the dmv have to sign to put it in there for super privacy unprotected but the dmv by itself can take it out so it's a revocation service and so you had that kind of controlled mutability uh there is also the ability for the council to remove really um you know child pornography or really bad things in files and smart contracts however the council does not have the ability in the code to touch the accounts or the um hts tokens or the hcs topics and the messages flowing through them there is no way to freeze an account there is no way to take hbars out of an account or to freeze a token or to take hbars or tokens out of the token out of your account there's no way to freeze a topic or to censor the messages flowing through it the software completely disallows that and you take most of the council signing something to change this this is this is kind of set in stone in the software itself where they cannot censor and um and control these things so that's what we mean sounds confusing when you say control mutability but it's also immutable and yes we have control mutability and it's also immutable so that's what we're talking about thank you leemon for explaining that i know that's a lot to wrap your head around um i'm going to lob one more to you now does hedera's no fork guarantee", "title": "What is \"controlled mutability\"?"}, {"end_time": 1730, "start_time": 1570, "text": "extend to after the hashgraph patent expires and if so how does it yeah so this is cool at the beginning it was very important that we have a multi-pronged approach to stop forking and over time the the patent part of that is becoming less and less needed because the other parts are becoming more and more important so what we have is a council that is amazing we have the majority now for 39 the 20s makes up a majority of 39 uh and they're really big names uh this council has turned out far better than you might have expected on day one it's it's just amazing and so um it looks kind of hard to build a council like this you know you look at other projects it looks like it's difficult to get a council like this they aren't just advisors they're actually governing and they're really big names um build brings a lot of trust it would be hard to fork because the fork wouldn't have such a council and i was just talking a second ago about the cryptographic proofs that the history is correct it's not just showing that it's changed the chain together like you would with a history of a blockchain it's actually showing that this particular council was signing off on it at each of those points the digital signatures themselves are part of it and so if they're a fork no one could ever fool you into thinking that other fork is the real one because the signatures wouldn't be on that other fork and so the technical ability here is really powerful and that's what the state proofs that we have right now with our mirror nodes and we'll even go further we have state proofs for every query and so we have these technical abilities and then the updates themselves to the software and the updates to the address book that controls who is running the node those themselves are controlled by the network itself in a way that ensures that you couldn't really fork and fool people if you ever tried to fork you everybody would know that it was a fork and then it wasn't the real one so you could easily have software when we have this the individual state proofs you'll have software on your phone that every time you ask us what's my balance or who owns this house who owns this nft you'll be guaranteed that you're talking to the real network and not to a disgruntled node that used to be part of us but now is part of a different network or maybe as i'm part of both at the same time you'll be guaranteed cryptographically that that's not happening because you'll essentially have signatures from our whole network of green and so we have more and more over time really powerful anti-forking guarantees so the part of the the patent is becoming much less important over time so it expires who cares and these other ones are turning out to be really powerful all right thank you leemon um the next one i'm

histories or you could set up separate mirror nodes and so you only have some of the shards or one of the shards that you're remembering and so you can set that up um and so yeah when we had 10 000 nodes they all go across shards latency within a shard gets worse as you increase the number of nodes but latency doesn't get worse when the number of shards increases there's no penalty for having more and more shards and so once you have filled up one shard there's no more latency hit as you add tens or millions of more nodes because they just go into more shards in fact having more shards should help us with throughput and overall speed so yes that is not a problem uh as for within a shard you would expect it to be logarithmic scaling so i was just talking to someone this week about that who even knew it was logarithmic didn't understand really what blog means it means that when you go from a thousand nodes to a billion nodes does it take a billion times more time or a lot or a million times more time no takes three times as long going from a thousand nodes to a billion nodes only takes three times as long because it's logarithmic that's the beauty of logarithmic curves they just grow very slowly so that's the technical answer great thanks lee men mance one for you", "title": "How will the network scale with the addition of permissionless nodes?"}, {"end_time": 2034,

that the whole world can see it and everybody will see the exact same vision of it now you may not need everyone to see it it might not need it to be stored on all that many computers and so you're just paying for an extra service you don't need and if you wanted privacy you'd have to encrypt it anyway and then you know you don't really care that anybody can see your ciphertext that's not really a bonus you're not really willing to pay for that so what typically people will do is they will store files gigantic files in a cloud because it's stored on fewer computers and has easier privacy controls and so that just makes sense um you'd store the bulk of your data in the cloud and then you would store hashes of it in a ledger and there you're paying for it to be stored a lot of different places and ensuring that the whole world can see it and then it guarantees you're showing everyone the same data and so typically people would do it splitting their data you sort of have the data in

talk about how high the throughput can potentially get in a single shard when it's unthrottled and after sharding is introduced how high can the throughput of the network potentially be great question oh we're getting a lot of technical ones i love it so we have done we right now throttle the network down to ten thousand you can do only do ten thousand transactions per second and our actual usage is a hundredth of that so you know we're using one percent of our capacity right now and our usage is growing and it's growing pretty rapidly um so it'll take a little bit a little while to get it to be a hundred times as bigger than it is right now but it will get there i think i think it'll get far beyond that i think we're gonna go far beyond ten thousand so there will be the demand at the moment though a demand is you know a hundredth of that but uh but we'll get there uh could we go faster well sure so in the lab we've tried making changes to the software then see have seen it running at many tens of thousands of transactions per second and that's with a merkle tree that's where every time you move something your balance changes it changes in a leaf of a merkle tree and we have to recalculate all the hashes in the merkle trees so we can sign the top of it once a second all of that was still running at many tens of thousands a second so you know it looks like um they'd ought to be possible to go much much faster but we haven't rolled it out and the reason is if you're gonna make a change like that then you want to test does it work with new features that we've just added and new features we're about to add that we're working on that we haven't even announced yet does it work well with those does it work well when someone falls off and has to reconnect and they're trying to catch up to a network that's moving faster does it work well there does it work well when you have to save the state to the disk periodically um does it just work you just want to try every possible scenario does it work well we have 100 million accounts instead of 100 000 accounts uh and we expect that to happen too so or entities at least especially with tokens tokens are great so what we what we would want to do is to not just make some changes and see that it's actually working at tens of thousands many tens of thousands what we want to do is test it thoroughly and see if there's any corner cases where it has a problem and then work on fixing those and and this is our list to do we will absolutely do this and this won't take all that long till we do it but it's not at the top of our list and the reason is because current usage is one percent of what we already are doing we're only at one percent we're only using one percent of our current throttle so there's not a whole lot of pressure to move the throttle up today i do think we're going to get to to the point maybe not all that far from now when we do need to raise the throttle and then we'll raise it a lot uh but right now our top priority is getting new features out and um and and making the system work in a lot of really cool ways that we keep announcing we had hcs and then hts and now we have other things we're working on this is what our top priority is we do have on the to-do list make the throttle even better than a hundred times current usage but it's not the very top priority because it's a

can't tell what the operating system is that the the application is running on top of on some server somewhere it's all of that is under the hood and it's opaque to you as as the user you just interact with the web app that's this the same is going to be true for us so if you look at uh the the coupon bureau for example and you go and you use a coupon at target and and that coupon gets scanned through the point of sale system well there's a lot that's going on under the hood that will end up using our infrastructure as well as the coupon bureau's infrastructure and the person using the coupon doesn't see any of that or you get a vaccine in the uk you know through the through the nhs the delivery and and infrastructure that makes it possible for you to receive that vaccine in part uses our technology that's completely opaque to the end user and that's going to be true increasingly what we what we see are ecosystems of users that have a common interest in a given application or use case deploying on top of hedera and in most cases the end users they don't see what's going on under the hood that's what rob was talking about that's what i was talking about in an interview with rob as well uh in a recent conference but that's what we mean when we say it'll be transparent to the end users all right thank you mance leeman if the security of one chart is

communications and catching any contradictions in state proofs that are shared between them oh great question and i just remembered you said sharding your previous question asked about sharding as well so i should have talked about that too so i'll answer them both right here sharding is a cool thing uh we're doing this we will be doing this other ledgers are doing it um and sharding gives you really high throughput so you know we i said many tens of thousands that was for a single chart for unlimited shards you have unlimited throughput i mean you really can you can do a million transactions a second if you have enough shards you can do a billion transactions a second if you have enough shards you can do a trillion transactions a second if you have enough shards now it only works if the transaction patterns are the are the right kind so what you would have to do is say well if our transactions end up getting spread out well across all the shards then there is no limit you could do you know quadrillion transactions per second if you had a quadrillion shards to do it and each one's only being given one transaction a second however if all of your transactions are going to one account transferring to one account and you don't have a replica of that account in other shards or sub accounts of it in other shards then of course shards don't help at all you'll run the speed of a single shard uh sharding didn't help and so what we would expect is that the real world is a mixture of both kinds and that you would take some steps like if it's a really popular account you sort of have sub-accounts and several other shards to kind of spread out the work there's various tricks you can do and so what you would expect is that sharding is incredibly useful we will absolutely be able to do more than a million a second when we have shards you know if you have enough shards you have any speed you want and i do expect that access patterns would be such that you could actually get in real world in the real world more than a million a second with us um and that's true there will also be cases where the excess patterns really do need to have a single shard be fast and in those cases we really will be fast so that's this answer to the speed the answer for the security is fascinating and this is true for any system that does sharding except we're a little bit better in some ways the whole point of sharding is that you don't keep the whole history of everything in every shard the whole point was to divide up your effort and so for a given account if it's stored in this shard alice has an account in this chart and bob has an account in this chart what you have to do is have this when alice wants to transfer to bob this shard has to send a message to this shard saying we have officially approved this transaction she has enough in the account the transaction is valid we are now deducting that from her account would you please add it to bob's this shirt over here can't actually see what the balance is in alice's account it isn't actually visible and so this one is going to have to just take this shard's word for it that alice did have that that much in her account and it has been properly deducted and her balance has now gone down that pride the proper amount that's all this shard can do and so this shard then will increment bob's now what this shard can verify is that that message that said hey please increment bob's because we've already documented alice's that that message is a perfectly valid message from this shard digitally signed by more than two-thirds or more than one-third or whatever of the people in this chart you have to say if it has been digitally signed by a bunch of people over here then we will believe it so in a single short network you need to have more than two-thirds of your nodes being honest and active in a sharded network you need to have more than two-thirds of the nodes in each shard being uh honest and active if they all shut down then the shard shuts down or too many of them shut down and the shard shuts down that only freezes that one shard which just means well we can't send a receive to alice but everybody can still do things otherwise so bob and carol can still send coins back and forth it's just alice that's kind of frozen so that's good if a chard freezes that's okay however if a shard is corrupted then you could just you know counterfeit h bars out of nothing or counterfeit tokens or lie about what a smart contract did i mean you could do anything and this is true for any sharded system this is even true for systems that have bridges between them where the bridge is a bunch of validators if you can corrupt them all in some cases if you don't have the equivalent of a state proof or cryptographic proofs you'd have problems and so the bottom line is that sharding is abft it is actually super secure for hedera as long as each shard has more than two thirds honest and so we'll have various mechanisms for doing that we can talk about that more in the future uh we're not doing sharding today but we'll do it and it will give you you know more than a million a second um sure if you have enough shards it'll be any number you can think of it really will happen but we will have abft the entire sharded system will be asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant because we have state proofs and finality and you have to have those two things and each chart is a bft that's how you get the whole thing being avft and so the shortage system will be very good but you have to make sure that each short is secure oh and then what if you aren't even worried about what if you aren't sure about that even there is one last thing you can do which is even better don't use a shard use an app net this is the hedera consensus service you can do all your processing in an app net you get enormous speed ups and greater privacy and it allows all the kinds of firewalling that was asked in this question this question really is not asking about sharding it's asking about app nets and so with an app net you're totally secure and if more than two-thirds of the app net isn't isn't honest if everybody in the app net is dishonest every single person um that's okay that just means that whatever was stored in the app net is compromised but this the network as a whole the hedera network isn't hurt at all so you're much safer from the app net the appnet can't do any harm as opposed to a shard that could do harm and you have greater privacy and you can even set up the app net where you know if you don't trust the people in the app net you run one of the nodes and so you're guaranteed to have security there's lots of cool things you can do with hap nets they can be much better than shards for some things but for other things charting is good and we'll do that too right thank you leemon um mance uh the next one for you hedera has", "title": "Can a failure in one shard

internet i don't even know how much i want to go into right now it's just it's a big subject we're very short on time the quantum internet is cool when it comes to sensors not when it comes to computers let me just say that so the quantum internet is allowed to transfer not data but not information but quantum information it's a different kind of thing and what it really should not be thought of as like an internet the quantum internet is not an internet it's not like connecting two quantum computers what it really is is a way to turn two quantum computers that are far apart into a single quantum computer that's what the quantum internet would do and for building a quantum computer well it's easier to put them all in the same room so why would you split it across states and slow it down and make it harder to do just put in the same room so just to combine these two to make a single quantum computer to do computation doesn't make any sense for sensors though you can do amazing things and there are some really magic things you can do in quantum mechanics with sensors including i can see you by by deciding whether or not to bounce light off of you and even if i don't bounce a single photon off of you i can still see you yeah that's quantum weirdness if the fact that i flipped a coin and could have bounced some light off of you lets me see you even though i didn't actually do it and there have been real real demonstrations of this and other things and quantum internet could actually connect widely separated satellites and make them act as one there's just amazing things you do with the quantum internet so that it would be a complement to hedera it would not be a replacement for hedera or for ledgers and it would not really be part of hedera or ledger's we're all about information not quantum information um so just be something really cool it's like saying well if we get self-driving cars what will the effect of that be on hedera well there's no real effect but the people using it could store data on on hedera and same thing with this you know the really cool things that your new sensors discovered could be stored on hudera then there's also the question that could quantum computers hurt hedera and other ledgers and the truth is the whole industry will just switch to different algorithms that aren't hurt it's not a big deal it's like a y2k there's some coding you have to do and it slows you down a little bit i hate that but it's not a big deal so that's the short answer i would love to talk a really long time about quantum stuff um there's just
